				The role of fish markets has been underestimated in many African countries. Not only do these markets provide employment directly to the local population but also generate jobs within the logistics system. These markets also cater for important volumes of transactions in fish and fish products bringing in foreign exchange. Two examples of fish markets are discussed below.

				The Minister responsible for fisheries in Mauritius recently announced that in 2016 the octopus’ fishery would be closed for two months (August and September) at national level. This decision follows a voluntary pilot octopus closure project in the south of Mauritius funded by the SmartFish programme and implemented by the Mauritius Marine Conservation Society. Results obtained shows that the closure period impacted positively as the octopus increased in size and weight to the delight of the fishers concerned.

				Having improved breeds for maximum production is a desire of many dairy farmers. However, getting embryos and quality breeds has been difficult due to the high costs involved. This is set to change with the launch of the first ever cow Invitro Fertilisation (IVF) Embryo Transfer (ET) laboratory by a Kenyan company; Indicus East Africa in partnership with a Brazilian company-Invitro Brasil. The Managing Director of the laboratory which is based in Uasin Gishu County will use genetics to improve cattle breeds which will be sold to farmers at affordable prices. Specifically, improvement of breeds through IVF locally will cut costs for farmers who have been importing pedigree animals from South Africa. The laboratory has the capacity to produce more than 20,000 embryos annually with a projected success rate of 45%. The technology has an advantage over that the traditional Artificial Insemination (AI) in that it has a capability of determining the ideal sex for the unborn calf.

				Cowsoko, a word coined from ‘cow’ and a Swahili word “soko” meaning ‘market’ is a novel online market for trading in cattle and related quality inputs in Kenya. The first if its kind in East Africa, the platform is a brainchild of a Kenyan entrepreneur who noticed a gap in the supply side-lack of a formal market for cattle and on the demand side- limited information and accessibility of quality cattle. Cattle traded on Cowsoko are bred by quality cattle vendors from their own recorded pedigree and non-pedigree herds. The founder of Cowsoko, a graduate of Animal Science from Egerton University pointed out that  Cowsoko is dedicated to empowering dairy farmers to connect with buyers, sellers and service providers anytime anywhere across the world. Noteworthy, is that Cowsoko enables farmers whether small-scale or large-scale, to explore opportunities in dairying and which were hitherto not accessible to them.However, setting up of Cowsoko has not been without the usual challenges that face star-ups. In particular, the business has struggled with cost of payment integration on the digital platform. The founder of Cowsoko noted that most service providers charge 3-4 % of the sales a situation that delayed plans to accept large payments on the platform. In addition, due to a few number of products traded on the platform, the business is faced with chronic deficit in supply at any one given time, a situation that compromises trust by customers. Lack of a criteria for valuation of dairy cows traded on the platform has also dealt the business a hard blow as customers become subjective in determination of prices. Despite these challenges the entrepreneur expressed confidence in the business noting that it is already serving markets in Rwanda and Uganda.

				Up-scaling research innovations in agriculture and livestock especially among vulnerable livelihoods is often a tough call for researchers and innovators. It is against this backdrop that the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is looking into partnering with group saving and loans organizations as a possible effective avenue conducting extension work on index-based livestock insurance (IBLI). However, there is little evidence to suggest that this kind of synergy has increased IBLI uptake above the 6-9% household baseline rate in the area according to findings of the latest research brief by ILRI. The study titled “Integrating index-based livestock insurance with community savings and loan groups in northern Kenya”, revealed that this is due to chronic vulnerability to drought-related shocks and declining coping abilities inhabitant communities. The study was as a result of collaboration between IBLI project and CARE Kenya with an objective of assessing impact of integrating an insurance product for pastoralists’ most productive asset alongside access to informal financial services.The study found substantive differences between the savings and loans groups profiled, including interest rates, collateral requirements, and savings-to-loan ratios. Nevertheless, members of savings and loans groups accumulated more savings and accessed more loans than their non-members. Despite these findings, increasing understanding of IBLI hinges on improving training of members of the groups and developing a package of more accessible educational tools for use.In addition the study revealed, most households are reluctant to borrow to purchase insurance, due to high interest rates and negative social and economic effects on default. As such, the study recommended further subsidization of insurance premiums or loans as one way of increasing IBLI uptake.

				According to research conducted by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), there are about 22 million indigenous chickens kept in the rural areas of Kenya under the free-range system. Indigenous chickens constitute an estimated 76 % of total poultry population and produce about 55% and 47% of total meat and eggs respectively underpinning the importance of the sub-sector. However, while free range poultry farming is considered simple and economical, the feeding program followed under this system often compromises on the quality of nutrients sufficient to support growth and eggs production. In fact, scavenging diets contain only 11.2% of mean Crude Protein (CP) too little to promote growth and egg production for a successful commercial venture. To put this situation to focus, egg production of indigenous chicken raised under free range system is about 40-100 compared to 150 eggs per year under improved housing, disease-control and feed supplementation. This is despite existence of feed supplements in the market such as fish meal, cotton seed, sunflower cake, maize germ, bone meal and oyster shells which are sold in smaller packs, therefore, affordable to rural farmers. Exacerbating the problem is existence of diseases which cause an average of 40-60% mortality rate in chicks in their first eight weeks against the backdrop of unaffordable vaccines. The research recommends that one way of farmers bringing the vaccine costs lower is by pooling together to form clusters that will enable them procure the drugs - and even feeds in bulk.Housing under free-range production is also underdeveloped in rural areas. An ideal poultry house should be comfortable, not crowded and protective of weather extremities, predators and diseases. In addition, in-breeding of free-range poultry among rural farmers is also a menace that contributes to low stock productivity. It was thus recommended that farmers of free-range poultry replace breeding stocks every year by introducing cocks from distant villages. To realize full economic benefits of free-range chicken, farmers should supplement traditional word of mouth marketing with other means such as social media marketing.
