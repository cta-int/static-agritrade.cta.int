				According to research conducted by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), there are about 22 million indigenous chickens kept in the rural areas of Kenya under the free-range system. Indigenous chickens constitute an estimated 76 % of total poultry population and produce about 55% and 47% of total meat and eggs respectively underpinning the importance of the sub-sector. However, while free range poultry farming is considered simple and economical, the feeding program followed under this system often compromises on the quality of nutrients sufficient to support growth and eggs production. In fact, scavenging diets contain only 11.2% of mean Crude Protein (CP) too little to promote growth and egg production for a successful commercial venture. To put this situation to focus, egg production of indigenous chicken raised under free range system is about 40-100 compared to 150 eggs per year under improved housing, disease-control and feed supplementation. This is despite existence of feed supplements in the market such as fish meal, cotton seed, sunflower cake, maize germ, bone meal and oyster shells which are sold in smaller packs, therefore, affordable to rural farmers. Exacerbating the problem is existence of diseases which cause an average of 40-60% mortality rate in chicks in their first eight weeks against the backdrop of unaffordable vaccines. The research recommends that one way of farmers bringing the vaccine costs lower is by pooling together to form clusters that will enable them procure the drugs - and even feeds in bulk.Housing under free-range production is also underdeveloped in rural areas. An ideal poultry house should be comfortable, not crowded and protective of weather extremities, predators and diseases. In addition, in-breeding of free-range poultry among rural farmers is also a menace that contributes to low stock productivity. It was thus recommended that farmers of free-range poultry replace breeding stocks every year by introducing cocks from distant villages. To realize full economic benefits of free-range chicken, farmers should supplement traditional word of mouth marketing with other means such as social media marketing.

				For the first time, Kenya will soon start exporting meat, vegetables and fruits to Qatar as a result of talks between the two countries. Meat exports from Kenya will rival those from Australian and New Zealand whose exports currently dominates the market. This comes in the wake of efforts by Qatar to increase production of meat and poultry products and substitute imports which currently stand at 90% of all food items.

		<title>To use Antibiotics as growth promoters in Livestock production or Not? The debate rages on</title>

				Can the gains made globally by use antibiotic in reduction of mortality rate caused by bacterial infections in both man and animals since their accidental discovery be watered down by the negative impact of use of antibiotics as growth promoters on the same health of human being and animals they serve to preserve? This is the question that has sparked renewed debate in the global arena. The debate is indeed warranted as recent studies show that misuse of antibacterial drugs has resulted in development of bacterial resistance over time. These studies revealed that farmers are the biggest culprits in use of antibiotics in livestock production directly or indirectly through a veterinary practitioners. Antibiotics have been found to boost poultry, beef cattle and pig production as they accelerate growth rate and increase muscle weight.  However, withdrawal period within which the antibiotics undergo total disintegration and excretion from the animal’s biological system before the animal or its products can be consumed is supposed to be observed. Unfortunately, due the ever increasing demand for livestock products, farmers do not observe the withdraw period before off-loading their products to the market thereby predisposing consumers of animal products to health complications related to mis-use of antibiotics.  Although the subject is not short of controversy the world over, the problem is premised on the fact that the same antibiotics used in man are used to control the same strain of bacteria in animals that kill “friendly bacteria” in humans thereby interfering with the floral balance in their bodies with ensuing adverse health effects. Compounding the situation is also that prolonged use of antibiotics is said to cause bacteria to change their genetic composition resulting to resistance to antibiotics that would ordinary work. Resistant strains can also be spread through water, soil or meat into human body system thereby predisposing even farm workers and farmers indirectly to infections.This debate has attracted the attention of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) which has raised a red flag on adulteration of antimicrobials and their widespread use by untrained personnel. As a result there is need for a harmonized framework worldwide for surveillance of antibiotics use in animals to safeguard the health of the people. In the same light, animal welfare activists are decrying use of antibiotics as growth promoters where animals are kept in hygienically neglected and crowded conditions without due regard to biosecurity. Calls to halt use of antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock production for public health safety are boosted by a study conducted in Denmark that found no economic losses for not using growth promoters after the country banned their use in poultry and pig production in 1999.
