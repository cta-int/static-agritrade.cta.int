				Birungi:What is ILRI doing in Tanzania in relation to building the capacity of the various value chain actors?Amos: We have been involved in research and development (R&amp;D) in Tanzania since 1997, working on market mechanisms, food safety and livestock policies. We increased our presence in the country by 2012 and finally opened an office in 2013 in order to engage more closely and effectively with stakeholders in addressing a number of challenges to improve poor people’s livelihoods through livestock. The current focus of our R&amp;D is on sustainable intensification of mixed crop-livestock systems through increasing productivity of the smallholder dairy value chains. The current engagement emphasises a value chain approach as opposed to previous engagements before 2012. We are implementing various projects with partners under the CGIAR Livestock and Fish program known as “More milk by and for the poor”, referred to locally as “Maziwa Zaidi”. The ‘by’ and ‘for’ the poor are important because this is about both food and nutrition security. As you will appreciate, livestock is probably the most easily accessible source of important nutrients for improving nutrition. And for a country like Tanzania with a stunting rate as high as 42%, the large livestock population is a very good nutritional source to tap into. Improved productivity of livestock will therefore not only address income and food security but will also address nutritional security.As already stated, we aim to do this by focusing on improving the smallholder dairy value chains. Due to low milk availability the focus is around improving access to and use of inputs (e.g. feed, breeding, animal health) and services (e.g. training, credit) to improve productivity and grow the short market linkages in the value chain so that the milk can reach more consumers. The short market linkages mainly involve small scale milk traders who collect only 50 to 100 litres of milk daily and sell to neighbours and local milk outlets. We also engage with the few larger players operating in the value chain such as Tanga Fresh and ASAS Dairies in the Southern highlands of Tanzania to link them to emerging smallholder farmer groups that our partners have established. Our role as research partners is to monitor how they evolve and prove that the smallholders can be targeted successfully and therefore deserve more investments. I should refer you to the recent 2012/13 national survey report released by both FAO and the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) that shows the opportunity gap for improving livelihoods that can be exploited. The report shows that only 20% of rural livestock keepers in Tanzania currently use livestock extension services and those that do earn  a net income of US$ 17 per animal (US$ 430 per herd) compared to only US$ 12 ( a net income of US$ 138 per herd) by those who don’t.  This shows what can be achieved when producers can access and use livestock extension services.  You can triple the annual income per household though interventions that reduce mortality rates and increase use of animal husbandry services. We are piloting interventions such as ‘dairy market hubs’ to achieve this. The ‘hubs’ bring together localised groups of smallholders with common interests in accessing inputs and services to achieve a critical mass of supply. As you will appreciate, when you have producers with small volumes of milk, they need to come together to enjoy economies of scale.  To achieve our aim of inclusive development of the dairy value chain, we work through partnerships involving a range of national and international stakeholders.  A more inclusive, viable, well-coordinated and efficient dairy marketing arrangements will contribute to improved income and livelihoods in rural areas. The focus on inclusivity entails a strong emphasis on gender. By  working not only on the input and services side but also on the marketing management side; we aim to balance the ‘pull’ and ‘push’ factors that we think are required to upgrade the smallholder value chains. In addition, whenever you work with a predominantly informal value chain which is the case in Tanzania and most parts of the East Africa Community (EAC) countries milk is often not pasteurised and packaged before sale, therefore addressing milk safety is important. We are addressing milk safety (and the nutrition component of our work) in the same value chains in collaboration with another CGIAR program on Agriculture, Nutrition and Health.  We want to ensure that consumers can access quality and safe products at affordable prices whether the milk is sold informally or formally.We contribute to capacity building at community and national levels. At community level, we are building dairy market hubs. The markets hubs act as flexible platforms that bring together farmers, with common interests in accessing inputs and services, and solving their problems collectively, and linking themselves with value chain actors and local government to access various services. These engagements extend to work in extensive areas where dairy farming has not taken root. Embracing these areas will help us generate evidence to prove a concept that poor marginalized communities in these areas can be targeted successfully. In the EAC generally, commercial dairy farming has only taken off in highland areas such as central Kenya or around Mount of Kilimanjaro and in the Southern highlands of Tanzania. This need not continue to be the case and is the reason we are testing the concept that commercial dairy farming can also take off in marginalised extensive areas provided they can access the required inputs and services.  Our motivation is the many benefits of dairy farming for rural livelihoods, economic development and poverty reduction. For example a study by IFPRI and ASARECA, found that the most promising agricultural commodity for improving incomes in Eastern Africa is milk. The study ranked dairy as having the highest contribution to potential gains to agricultural GDP relative to other crop and livestock commodities. The contribution of dairy farming to rural livelihoods and nutritional security, especially in Kenya, demonstrates this quite well. So we are quite excited to use milk as a commodity of focus to improve the livelihoods of livestock keepers in Tanzania as well.In implementing the pilot interventions, we work closely with the Tanzania Dairy Board and Faida Market Linkages, a local NGO.  We also work very closely with international development organizations that are based in Tanzania such as HEIFER International and SNV-Netherlands Development Organisation. Research partners involving ILRI and national research partners play the role of monitoring the impact of the interventions being tested at household and community levels besides conducting various experiments and targeted studies to identify solutions for specific constraints.The national research partners that are involved in generating evidence are Sokoine University (SUA) and Tanzania Livestock Research Institute (TALIRI). The capacities in the partnership (at individual and institutional levels) are enhanced as we work and learn together as well as through short- and long-term training opportunities for students who contribute to generation of research results. We also strengthen capacity at the national level where we set up the Dairy Development Forum (DDF) with a secretariat at the Tanzania Dairy Board which brings together value chain actors and other stakeholders involved in dairy research development in Tanzania to find solutions to common problems that individual organisations or private firms cannot address individually. The Forum also provides a space and opportunity for individual business linkages to take place. Studying how such platforms at national, regional and district various levels evolve and contribute to scaling out of innovations is of major interest in our research. That summarises the core of our current and long term research we do to improve smallholder dairy value chains in Tanzania. We look forward to consolidating the evidence on what works well, where and how in our key pilot sites in Morogoro and Tanga and use that to attract public and private investments for a pro-poor transformation of the smallholder dairy value chains.Additionally, we are embarking on new R&amp;D projects that reinforce the work we are already doing on sustainable intensification. A three year endeavour starting 2016 will support the development of a platform for more efficient dairy production and upgraded dairy value chains.  This platform will support the development and piloting of digital platforms through a farmer-focused public-private partnership for on-farm data recording and timely, actionable cow and herd management feedback to farmers, as well as continuously evaluating, selecting, certifying and promoting the use of appropriate breeding bulls and heifers, thus leading to more efficient dairy production and upgraded dairy value chains. ILRI will also be supporting the Department of Livestock to develop a Livestock Master Plan in 2016. The plan will define pathways where investments for commercialisation would provide the greatest returns for given livestock sub-sectors and thus attract more investments. A newly launched two-year initiative also led by ILRI aims to support the veterinary department, regulators of the delivery of animal health services and the private sector to scale up the delivery of infection and treatment method (ITM), and vaccines for East Coast fever (ECF) through facilitation of the delivery value chain.Birungi:In your view what are the key challenges that you are addressing in the livestock sector?Amos: The key challenges are the lack of the economies of scale in milk marketing because volumes produced by small holder producers are small. Secondly, farmers cannot easily access capital especially those poor often non bankable communities in rural areas. To be more commercial, farmer must have capital to invest in inputs and services. As I said earlier in relation to the recent report by FAO and NBS, the use of improved inputs and services can triple incomes of livestock keepers.There is also no mechanism in place to source milk from small scale pre-commercial producers. Previous interventions have not worked well in Tanzania and this is the reason why we are piloting the dairy markets hubs to address the needs of the commercial producers to access and use more inputs and services. The other main challenge is shortage of feeds and the strong effects of seasonality in feed availability between the dry and wet seasons. The question is how to work with farmers not only to conserve feeds but also to encourage fodder markets to alleviate the big shortages.And a cross cutting area that we are addressing is the threat or marginalization of female value chain actors as the value chain is upgrading.  As you may know, this is not unique to the dairy value chain. When agricultural commodities become more commercial, and there is more money being generated, women are normally displaced by men and we want to prevent that because it is only in having equity that we can achieve acceleration in upgrading of the value chain.Birungi: Are there any policy challenges? Yes, there are a number of policy challenges and this is part of the reason why we facilitated the formation of the Dairy Development Forum so that it can be a platform for addressing not only the policy challenges but also others interventions that are needed to improve the smallholder dairy value chains in inclusive ways.A key policy challenge is also one of mindsets that do not support smallholders. For many countries in the region the predominant thinking is that their economies need to grow and that this cannot be effectively done on the back of smallholder agriculture. Inclusivity in economic growth is often a secondary consideration. Increasingly in both developing and even the developed world the income gap continues to widen. So to us, proving this concept that the poor can be targeted successfully and having more investments (both public and private) directed at upgrading the pre-commercial value chain approaches is an important policy issue that we are addressing. So it is more of a mindset change so that next time there is a major investment, such as a loan coming in the Tanzania government, or may be some philanthropic investment, the investment would not necessarily have to go to areas where traditionally we would have the greatest returns in terms of the amount of money that you get but also to have the greatest return in terms of the poor people that it can impact.To address this policy issue, besides the Dairy Development Forum, ILRI co-facilitated a process that culminated in the launching of the Tanzania Livestock Modern Acquisition Initiative on the 20th of July 2015. The aim was to raise the profile of livestock and attract investments in the areas mentioned earlier.Birungi: Lastly on the issue of policy - is pricing a challenge in Tanzania? We found it to be an issue in Kenya and Uganda. When you talk of pricing of fresh milk, you have to look at both the informal and formal sectors. Pricing is an issue in the formal sector because a number of investors in this sector complain about a number of regulations and licenses that they must obtain and some of these must be renewed annually. These end up being factored into the consumer price. But bear in mind that in Tanzania the formal sector currently accounts for only about 2% or 3% of the milk that is marketed. Most of the milk is marketed informally where consumer prices are lower. Birungi: What opportunities are there in the Tanzania livestock sector?Amos: Tanzania has the 3rd largest livestock population in the African continent, so the potential is quite huge. But it is under exploited mainly because there is low public and private sector investment in the sector. As an example, Githunguri dairy cooperative in Kenya is able to collect and process between 180,000 and 200,000 litres per day from farmers within a radius of 50 km compared to the situation here in Tanzania where the largest processor has capacity of only 60,000 litres daily and utilises less than 60% of the installed capacity depending on the season, with some of the milk collected as far as 400km away. So there is a huge opportunity here for one to invest in getting small scale producers and value chain actors to come together so that they can engage with big processors. It is the same thing you can say about back yard chicken producers. Very few private investors will want to invest in organizing small scale producers. If there could be a public-private partnerships where public funds are spent in organizing small producers so that they are better able to engage with the private sector then the big players  would be quite happy to collect the milk, eggs and chickens from small scale producers.So a key intervention area is strengthening public - private sector collaboration so that the private sector has got a better enabling environment for them to engage in doing what they do best, with the public sector funding targeting areas such as creation of farmer groups and encouraging collective action. I think supporting growth of small businesses that operate in these areas is the most effective way we can achieve the kind of pro poor transformation of the value chain that the stakeholders here seek.Birungi: Would that be the same answer you would give in terms of the future prospects of the sector?Amos: Yes, that is exactly what I would say about the future prospects of the sector. It can’t be done by the private sector alone; there must be public sector support for an enabling environment for the private sector to grow. The private sector prefer the urban and peri-urban areas where they can easily  make profits, but if you want to have these broad based development, then you need to have public and private sector partners co-operating to spur growth in the more marginalized extensive areas and get pre commercial producers in those areas to become more commercial.Birungi: You did mention that the formal daily milk sector constitutes only about 2 to 3%, the rest is informal. Have you found this to be attractive to foreign investors? There are a number of European investors coming into the Uganda and Kenya dairy sectors. Amos: It is happening in a different way because people see the potential. For example, we will from 2016 start partnering in a research project with Wageningen University that involves a large dairy company in Europe and a South East Asian company known as Royal Friesland Campina that will use their CSR funds to collaborate in piloting inclusive business models. It could be said that this is in anticipation that when the value chain grows and is upgraded the small producers will be better able to engage with such large European private sector firms. As it is, I don’t see much opportunity of having external players the way you have in Kenya.Finally, I need to highlight that we would not be able to engage in the R&amp;D work above without the generous support of a number of development partners including the CGIAR Consortium, International Fund for Agricultural Development, the governments of Australia, Ireland, the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, the International Development Research Centre and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

				Birungi:How is Nestlé involved in the dairy business?Schärer: One of Nestlé’s core businesses is Dairy which involves procuring and processing of milk. Globally, our largest dairy operations are in India, China, Pakistan and Indonesia. In Africa, we have milk processing plants in Kinshasa (DR Congo), Luanda (Angola) and Zimbabwe. Africa has a significantly high milk production capacity. In Kenya for instance, the milk output is estimated at 4 – 6 billion litres per year. However, very little of this milk is processed with most of it traded and consumed through informal channels. More has to be done to structure the industry since it remains dominated by small scale farmers. Priority should be put into measures to ensure development and commercialisation. It is worth noting that the East Africa region is the milk reservoir of the African continent.However, this sizeable milk production in the region is not matched with equally sizeable processing companies. In addition, there are few international players in the region.Birungi:What models do you think would be appropriate for big processors like Nestlé to succeed in the EAC region?Schärer: Any strategies to enable big processors thrive should ease the access to local, regional and international markets. Linking to these big markets would then make value addition viable. A case in point is Fonterra Ltd in New Zealand that opted to export its milk products on realizing that the population in New Zealand was limited. It is an option for Kenya and the region too if we ensured that the processed products can compete internationally in terms of quality and price.Birungi: What are the challenges facing the sector in the EAC region? Schärer: Although the opportunities in the region are rather similar, the challenges differ between countries. Seasonality is a challenge. It makes milk supply fluctuate over time hence processing plants are forced to operate below capacity. Seasonality can be addressed through dairy development programmes concentrating on dairy belts.As a result of seasonality, prices fluctuate following an inverse trend. This makes planning and improving the sector difficult and unpredictable. When farmers have sizeable volumes and prices fall as a result, they reduce their profits because the cost of producing a unit of milk does not fluctuate as much as pricing between and within seasons. On the other hand, when prices are high, farmers do not have milk to sell so they do not benefit. For example, in the current context, in Kenya, prices can go as high as Kshs 40 per litre of milk and as low as below Kshs 30 per litre. It is also the same case in Uganda where prices can go to as high as UGX 1,000 per litre and as low as less than UGX 600 per litre. The price spikes are mirrored by volume fluctuations. For processors, this is not ideal in business terms because their cost of running the plants remains relatively the same whether they are operating at full capacity or otherwise.The state of infrastructure is constraining smallholder farmers from accessing markets. While in Asia it is common to see processors setting-up cooling infrastructure close to the farmers, it is the opposite in the EAC, where the cooling network is mainly centralized in large centers. This challenge has limited the growth of the sector which is largely small scale. The model Nestlé implements is one where the cooling plants are numerous and small, and decentralized in areas where the milk is produced. Currently a lot of milk is produced in the region but not collected. The quality of milk is another challenge. In my view, there is only a single milk standard called ‘good quality’. The East African milk consumer has the same expectations as any other milk consumer in the world. To achieve quality, the value chain should be controlled making the role of a regulator important. The regulator should define standards and enforce compliance. My observation of the dairy sector in the EAC region confirms that although the regulators are in existence, implementation of standards is still difficult e.g. milk hawking is still rampant.   With improved road infrastructure in the milk producing areas, farmers would be able to deliver milk in its best quality to the cooling centres – within two hours of milking.Birungi: What opportunities do you see in the dairy sector in the EAC? Schärer: Market availability is the main opportunity and especially if the region can explore markets beyond its borders. This opportunity would even be bigger if the region could explore the global market where demand is estimated to be growing at 5% against a supply growth of 3% per year. Milk production in the EAC is significant compared to other parts of the continent. For instance, Kenya and Uganda are producing about 4-6 billion litres and 2 billion litres of milk per year respectively (estimates). This is a lot of milk if only it was properly handled and processed to enter the commercial market.  This means working with farmers can yield even more milk that is of improved quality.Furthermore, the dairy industry is dominated by local investors. There are opportunities of attracting foreign investment through formulation of appropriate policies. It is interesting that there is a larger presence of international dairy companies in West Africa yet the region does not produce as much milk as the EAC. Foreign investors would increase competition by driving dairy development and quality upwards which is a pre-requisite for growth.Birungi: Do you think foreign investors eyeing the region would have to integrate dairy development as part of their strategies? Schärer: Although I may not know how other players approach the same issue, for Nestlé, it is definitely the case. If a company focuses only on collecting volumes, chances are that competitors would perform better if they integrate building relations with the suppliers. Nestlé combines milk procurement and dairy development to ensure efficiency and quality, while securing the long-term sustainability of the dairy farming sector. Procurement ensures collection of volumes that meet quality while dairy development encourages growth of business relations between the company and farmers. In Pakistan for instance, Nestlé deals directly with farmers, limiting as much as possible engaging with middle men and works also with women extension. This arrangement significantly increases returns to farmers. Birungi: What would you say about the financing products and mechanisms available in this region?Schärer: I would categorize the problem of finance availability and accessibility as a threat to the dairy sector. Money is available in the region but the cost of accessing it is prohibitive. Models that ensure financing is readily available and affordable should be encouraged. Some of those models include matching grants as long as all parties involved are willing to meet their part of the obligation. A financing model that Nestlé has used in some Asian Markets is to negotiate with banks to extend credit to dairy farmers at favourable rates and in return, the farmers would open bank accounts in those banks so that re-payments are made from the monthly income they receive from milk sold. This reduces the risk of defaulting.Birungi: Do you think an electronic platform can help in addressing the current challenges of the dairy sector?Schärer: Although I may not have a definite answer to this, I would like to say that some electronic platforms have worked while others have not brought any change. The use of electronic platforms should be pursued on case by case basis.

				Having improved breeds for maximum production is a desire of many dairy farmers. However, getting embryos and quality breeds has been difficult due to the high costs involved. This is set to change with the launch of the first ever cow Invitro Fertilisation (IVF) Embryo Transfer (ET) laboratory by a Kenyan company; Indicus East Africa in partnership with a Brazilian company-Invitro Brasil. The Managing Director of the laboratory which is based in Uasin Gishu County will use genetics to improve cattle breeds which will be sold to farmers at affordable prices. Specifically, improvement of breeds through IVF locally will cut costs for farmers who have been importing pedigree animals from South Africa. The laboratory has the capacity to produce more than 20,000 embryos annually with a projected success rate of 45%. The technology has an advantage over that the traditional Artificial Insemination (AI) in that it has a capability of determining the ideal sex for the unborn calf.

				Cowsoko, a word coined from ‘cow’ and a Swahili word “soko” meaning ‘market’ is a novel online market for trading in cattle and related quality inputs in Kenya. The first if its kind in East Africa, the platform is a brainchild of a Kenyan entrepreneur who noticed a gap in the supply side-lack of a formal market for cattle and on the demand side- limited information and accessibility of quality cattle. Cattle traded on Cowsoko are bred by quality cattle vendors from their own recorded pedigree and non-pedigree herds. The founder of Cowsoko, a graduate of Animal Science from Egerton University pointed out that  Cowsoko is dedicated to empowering dairy farmers to connect with buyers, sellers and service providers anytime anywhere across the world. Noteworthy, is that Cowsoko enables farmers whether small-scale or large-scale, to explore opportunities in dairying and which were hitherto not accessible to them.However, setting up of Cowsoko has not been without the usual challenges that face star-ups. In particular, the business has struggled with cost of payment integration on the digital platform. The founder of Cowsoko noted that most service providers charge 3-4 % of the sales a situation that delayed plans to accept large payments on the platform. In addition, due to a few number of products traded on the platform, the business is faced with chronic deficit in supply at any one given time, a situation that compromises trust by customers. Lack of a criteria for valuation of dairy cows traded on the platform has also dealt the business a hard blow as customers become subjective in determination of prices. Despite these challenges the entrepreneur expressed confidence in the business noting that it is already serving markets in Rwanda and Uganda.

				Up-scaling research innovations in agriculture and livestock especially among vulnerable livelihoods is often a tough call for researchers and innovators. It is against this backdrop that the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is looking into partnering with group saving and loans organizations as a possible effective avenue conducting extension work on index-based livestock insurance (IBLI). However, there is little evidence to suggest that this kind of synergy has increased IBLI uptake above the 6-9% household baseline rate in the area according to findings of the latest research brief by ILRI. The study titled “Integrating index-based livestock insurance with community savings and loan groups in northern Kenya”, revealed that this is due to chronic vulnerability to drought-related shocks and declining coping abilities inhabitant communities. The study was as a result of collaboration between IBLI project and CARE Kenya with an objective of assessing impact of integrating an insurance product for pastoralists’ most productive asset alongside access to informal financial services.The study found substantive differences between the savings and loans groups profiled, including interest rates, collateral requirements, and savings-to-loan ratios. Nevertheless, members of savings and loans groups accumulated more savings and accessed more loans than their non-members. Despite these findings, increasing understanding of IBLI hinges on improving training of members of the groups and developing a package of more accessible educational tools for use.In addition the study revealed, most households are reluctant to borrow to purchase insurance, due to high interest rates and negative social and economic effects on default. As such, the study recommended further subsidization of insurance premiums or loans as one way of increasing IBLI uptake.

				The MoreMilkiT project works with milk traders in Morogoro and Tanga regions of Tanzania to set up dairy market hubs that will be used to pilot approaches to increase milk production and marketing. Funded by IrishAid, the project is implemented principally by International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in partnership with Faida MaLi, Tanzania Dairy Board, Sokoine University of Agriculture and Heifer International as the implementing partners. As part of on-going activities, the project recently held a five-day business opportunity seminar in Morogoro to train 23 milk traders, including six women, from 22 project villages in Morogoro and Tanga. The seminar focused on milk marketing and dairy business management practices aimed at helping producers cum traders to add value to their milk and identify business opportunities for selling inputs and services. In particular, the seminar enabled trainees to develop individual business plans including enterprise budgets that will be a basis for their subsequent mentoring and coaching. It was facilitated by Faida MaLi, one of the implementing partners of the project. Trainees reported that the seminar allowed them an opportunity to network with others players in the dairy value chain while noting that business plans would help them improve and expand their milk businesses. The trainees were expected to later train other traders within the network of the project.

				For the first time, Kenya will soon start exporting meat, vegetables and fruits to Qatar as a result of talks between the two countries. Meat exports from Kenya will rival those from Australian and New Zealand whose exports currently dominates the market. This comes in the wake of efforts by Qatar to increase production of meat and poultry products and substitute imports which currently stand at 90% of all food items.

				Kenya’s has been locked away from the EU beef market for a long time now. This has been due to in part endemic prevalence of the foot and mouth disease in the country. However, fortunes are slowly changing with release of a new livestock vaccine by researchers from the Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute (Kevevapi) to control the disease. It was developed after three years of trial and testing. An official from Kevevapi reported that trials of the vaccine and the first batch of 430,000 doses that can immunize the same number of animals is ready. The announcement was made during a launch of the re-aligned strategic plan of the institute for the period 2013-2017. The new oil-based vaccine is an improvement from the current water-based one and is hailed to have long immunity period and a longer shelf life.

				Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania are set to benefit from a program-“Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT-2)”-that aims at mitigating risks of diseases to livestock and human. The initiative will also support broader goals of risk assessments and management by better defining livestock production and marketing systems. This was announced during a two-day program launch in Kenya between 12th and 13th January 2016. EPT-2 is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to the tune of USD 87 million and coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).During the launch, the Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries who officiated the event noted that Eastern African countries feature highly on the list of high-risk countries where zoonotic diseases such as Ebola and MERS-Cov are endemic. Indeed, researchers have found that over ten zoonotic diseases are responsible for 2.2 million human deaths annually especially in low and middle income countries. The five year program (2015-2019) represents part of the US Government’s investment into the country-led Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). It aims at mitigating hazards resulting from biological risks by accelerating progress in ensuring countries have robust systems to prevent, detect and respond to pandemic zoonotic diseases and also to curb the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Based on recommendations from the meeting, teams will be constituted in the implementing countries in collaboration with a number of national and international partners to prepare country implementation plans which should be concluded by end of February 2016.

				Uganda beef market is set for a take-off with the establishment of an $11 million modern abattoir in Luwero District, 32 Km from Kampala by an Egyptian firm Egypt-Uganda Food Security. Currently, the country falls short of supplying the market with 900,000 tonnes of both processed and unprocessed beef products per year, a situation that is poised to change when the abbatoir gets fully operational. The Egypt-Uganda Food Security abattoir will have an operational capacity to slaughter 1,000 cows daily and hold up to 5,000 animals waiting to be slaughtered. In addition, the abattoir will perform other functions such as cooling and processing of the meat in accordance with requirements of the relevant authorities: Kampala City Council Authority and the Uganda National Bureau of Standards. The management of the abattoir is expressing enthusiasm at the prospects of exploiting a burgeoning demand for beef products in the EAC region and beyond and plans to use the strategic location of Uganda to process, package and distribute products in regional export markets. According to industry players, there is commendable growth in the beef industry in Uganda which has moved from 191,280 MT in 2012 to 230,000 MT between 2014 and early 2015 a trend that can be improved to target emerging markets. Currently, production constraints abound in Uganda majorly due to largely subsistence and existence of slow maturing indigenous breeds coupled with sluggish transition to commercial production. Secondly, with only two meat processing companies with recognizable standards in the country - Quality Fresh Cuts and Rosa, the country cannot poise itself to meet demand for beef products with the same speed with which it is growing. According to Uganda Meat Producers Co-operative Union Ltd, there is no shortage of abattoirs in Uganda-however, they are sub-standard and largely do not observe hygiene requirements. The Union also cautions that market growth for processed meat is a long shot as currently, most Ugandans prefer freshly cut meat; processed meat products is only a preserve of just a small fraction of high end consumers.
