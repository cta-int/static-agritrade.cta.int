				For the first time, Kenya will soon start exporting meat, vegetables and fruits to Qatar as a result of talks between the two countries. Meat exports from Kenya will rival those from Australian and New Zealand whose exports currently dominates the market. This comes in the wake of efforts by Qatar to increase production of meat and poultry products and substitute imports which currently stand at 90% of all food items.

				Seasonal variations in feed quality and availability is a rampant problem that constrains smallholder pig farmers in Central Uganda. However, this need not be as a recent study found out that locally available feed stuff, when properly rationed can provide sufficient and cost-effective feed for optimal pig production. The study, whose objective was to abridge nutritional value of locally available feed ingredients additionally established that pig farmers are also constrained with high cost of feed and limited knowledge to formulate low-cost nutritionally balanced formulas. Indeed, nutritious feed materials for pigs such as low- to no cost planted forages and opportunistic forages (weeds) and fruits, crop residues and agricultural co-products are available and within reach of farmers seasonally. These materials could be ingredients of nutritious rations to meet pigs’ dietary requirements to improve growth performance while minimizing feed costs.

				Kenya is joining global efforts in eradicating Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as ‘goat plague’ by developing its national strategy towards this end. PPR is a deadly and highly contagious viral disease that affects sheep and goats.  Currently, the disease causes heavy losses especially in goats and is one of the most damaging livestock diseases in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Various components of the strategy were discussed during a workshop convened by 
ILRI and FAO and attended by county veterinary service providers earlier in October 2015. The African Union’s Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) was also represented at the workshop. The workshop focused on determining the current incidence and prevalence rates of this deadly disease in seven semi-arid counties and formulating scenarios for estimating costs and benefits of various control strategies. It emerged that county governments are implementing different approaches towards PPR control. As such, it was recommended that an investigative study be carried out to determine effects of these different approaches in addition to informing ongoing discourse on PPR control at national level. Earlier in 2015, a strategy towards eliminating the disease by 2030 was formulated under the patronage of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) at a conference in Côte d’Ivoire. The strategy of the Kenyan government focuses on strengthening veterinary services across affected countries and creation of more cost effective ways to control other priority livestock diseases. It postulates a consistent approach at national level towards PPR eradication which is based on four main stages ranging from epidemiological and socio-economic assessment.

		<title>Adopt Modern Technology to increase honey production and get new markets:” Beef Farmers in Uganda Urged</title>

				Recent market trends for honey in Uganda have sent positive signals for a growth trajectory of the sub-sector that is very good news to the industry’s players- what with access of certified honey from the country to EU markets and increasing use of honey as a healthier alternative to sugar in many households in Uganda. However, these gains appear that they might not translate to much as honey producers in the country are unable to increase production by 100% from the current 500,000 MT per annum to meet these emerging market opportunities. The biggest culprit of this status quo is said to be the inability of farmers to adopt modern bee keeping technologies such as high yielding beehives.According to “The Hive”, an organization that promotes bee-keeping in 12 African countries including Uganda, a modern beehive would yield 54–78kgs of honey per annum; compared to the traditional one which gives very little at the same time destroying the colonies. As such, beekeepers in Uganda are urged to adopt new honey production technologies not only because of increasing demand for honey nationally and internationally but also due to the commensurate increase in demand of other more premium bee products. These calls from the private sector have been backed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) which is imploring farmers to seek advice from district entomology officers to help them in their bee-keeping projects.
