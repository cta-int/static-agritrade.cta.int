				The role of fish markets has been underestimated in many African countries. Not only do these markets provide employment directly to the local population but also generate jobs within the logistics system. These markets also cater for important volumes of transactions in fish and fish products bringing in foreign exchange. Two examples of fish markets are discussed below.

				The Aquacultural Association of Kenya (AAK) established in 2007 is the national umbrella body for all fish farmers in Kenya. It focuses on issues affecting its members (20,000 to date and increasing) and also caters for the aquaculture industry at large. The association also serves as a link between fish farmers, the national and county governments, development partners, other farmer’s organizations and stakeholders within the aquaculture sub-sector.

				In Africa, women have always played an important role in the fisheries and aquaculture sector, be it in production or marketing of the fish landed or produced through aquaculture. Lately African women have started to express their potential into value addition and innovations in the sector. A brief on three such exceptional women follows.

				The Minister responsible for fisheries in Mauritius recently announced that in 2016 the octopus’ fishery would be closed for two months (August and September) at national level. This decision follows a voluntary pilot octopus closure project in the south of Mauritius funded by the SmartFish programme and implemented by the Mauritius Marine Conservation Society. Results obtained shows that the closure period impacted positively as the octopus increased in size and weight to the delight of the fishers concerned.

				Mr Chris Short has more than 30 years of professional experience in the field of Business and Trade Development related to the fisheries sector. He is also well versed in other areas such as planning, project feasibility, evaluation and bankable projects. Chris has contributed in developing artisanal fisheries in a number of countries with special emphasis on value-chain assessments and upgrades for improved trade. His most recent activities include business planning and development for international investments and trade related to fisheries and aquaculture projects.Is regional fish trade a myth in the region?Regional trade is growing and will continue to grow. Due to an historic focus on outside markets such as Europe, the data available that records regional trade is less clear, with large volumes of unrecorded fish trade going unnoticed. Experience from the region shows that in fact regional fish trade is immense and is only stopped from growing due to a lack of supply.  Fish trade does not mean food security, as fish that could well be consumed in a country, may well be exported, leaving the home population wanting. Imports of cheap fish and export of fish for a higher price is a general philosophy, but can also mean that local fish of better quality is exported, whilst imported lessor quality fish becomes the only affordable source of fish protein for the majority of a generally poor population base.Is regional trade a myth? Definitely not! It is there and assuming supply is maintained, will only increase in the future. It is hoped that as this develops, national level food security will be a priority for Governments. Unfortunately the greed for profits does not always focus attention on the real issue of future food security.How is the Indian Ocean Commission-SmartFish Programme supporting the enhancement of regional trade in the fisheries sector?Regional fish trade is not something that is easily enhanced with such a small programme budget compared to the regional requirements. However, a key issue facing fish trade regionally is the ability to move fish whilst maintaining quality. Fishing methods, handling on boats, landing and handling fish onshore, as well as artisanal processing methods and poor logistics and transport means that the majority of fish are poor quality by the time they reach even the closest markets. Even fresh fish sold close to the point of capture are not in good shape a few hours after leaving the water.IOC SmartFish programme has focused attention of establishing what standards should be through regional level protocols, standards development and communication, however the translation of this to the various fish supply chains is the challenge. This has been supported by comprehensive and wide-spread training either directly to value chain actors, or through training of trainers who then provide training to a wider stakeholder audience. Campaigns with videos and messages have been disseminated in a number of countries including targeting schools as well as fishing communities. Value chain support activities to improve methods of handling, with equipment for improved landing, processing, packaging and retailing have also been used.Again referring to budgets, the programme is relatively small and cannot possibly support all the needs of such a vast area, so a piloting approach to demonstrate what is possible has been the only realistic way forward, with communication to others in the region on what is possible to encourage uptake of improved methods once the incentive of profit potential is understood, when activities that show potential are quickly copied by others.How has value chain analysis benefitted the fisheries sector in Madagascar?The primary example for VCA in Madagascar has been with a focus on mud crab. Analysis was undertaken for the species and identified various points where post- harvest losses were occurring. This included quality losses and a related loss in price, as well as volume losses (death of crabs resulting in no sales). As a result of this analysis many activities have been implemented to improve the situation, from new capture technique to increase catch, to holding methods to keep crabs alive and transportation systems (simple stackable crates) that prevent losses compared to previous methods of using sacks for instance that meant that the crabs would not survive the trip to markets.The overall impact of this has been significant, with IOC SmartFish taking the ideas to many communities around the country with immediate interest due to the financial incentive demonstrated. A huge part of the success of this initiative is that the methods are easily replicated cheaply so many people can copy quickly and see immediate gains.Can you give us an insight on future developments in the fisheries and aquaculture sector from an IOC-SmartFish perspective?The future is all about enough protein for a growing population and the contribution of fish to that protein requirement. Population in the region is growing extremely fast and there is not enough fish to satisfy demand. The consumption of fish in Africa is generally lower than other areas on average; this is more related to a lack of fish for the population, than a lack of actual demand. The challenge facing the future of the sector therefore is where will the fish come from? Supply of fish for this growing population first comes from existing capture fisheries, which unfortunately is poorly managed in the region. Aquaculture is growing slowly in the region as compared to other areas of the world, but is gaining interest and will eventually be a major contributor, as long as countries move to aggressively remove risks that currently prevent a larger number of serious investors coming to the region (political, security, financial and other risks all contributing).Together with fish farming, imports are a necessary requirement and will always be a large contributor to the sector’s activity. Imports are a quick and easy way forward to feed the population, but risk of poor quality has to be controlled in the process. Another real potential exists in the reduction of post-harvest losses, which would immediately contribute a significant volume of the requirements. So the future of the sector will be a combination of many factors that keep supplies of safe to eat fish available in the region as the population grows.Unfortunately the timing of these contributors of fish supply are out of sync, in that capture fisheries have reduced supply, aquaculture is not providing much at all, imports are increasingly poor quality fish, (significantly from Asia) and post-harvest losses continue to remain high, despite all the communication on the subject. This is all happening whilst countries and projects, such as SmartFish, continue to promote the consumption of fish. Clearly much work is still to be done in the region to bring the fisheries sector to its full potential as a supplier of good quality protein for the future.

				You have recently been elected as the  president of the “Fédération des Pêcheurs Artisans de L'Océan Indien” and the Federation has been officially launched. What are your priorities?The first thing would be to set up the organisation i.e. ensure that all the paper works are done which includes the official registration of the organisation. The organisation will be based in Reunion Island, so I also need to ensure that we have the necessary space for the staff, which will soon be recruited. I would also need to get the support and official recognition from the Fisheries Authorities of the region. Another aspect which I would need tolook into urgently is the funding of the organisation. Here seeking assistance from donor organisations both at the regional and international level would be a priority. In the same context, I would also like to request the assistance from other development partners, like the SmartFish Programme, CTA, UNDP and others.I would like also to prioritize the capacity building for the leaders of the organisation in the first instance to ensure that we do have a capable leadership at the head of the organisation.We are presently working on a programme of activities for the first year of operation and hope that this will serve as a guide for activities to be undertaken at a later stage.Another priority would be the development of an active network. This would include retired resource persons who can provide a helping hand to the organisation. I am pretty sure that there are many people willing to assist us.You mentioned capacity building. Would that also include fishers of the region?The fisheries sector is presently undergoing drastic changes. With the phenomenon of climate change, we are not sure what will happen in the years to come. I think that artisanal fishers should also be ready to adapt to changing environment. We have noted that in some of the countries e.g. Mauritius, Madagascar there has been a decline in landings over the last few years from the artisanal sector. However, no measures have so far been proposed to the fishing community. Fishers are facing a difficult time. We would like to be able to make suggestions to the concerned authorities and work hand in hand to better cope with this kind of situation. That is why building capacity of fishers is a top priority.With assistance from development partners, we will fine-tune the kind of training needed in each country as the level of development of the artisanal sector in the IOC countries differs. So training will focus on specific needs of the countries in question. How does the artisanal sector contribute to the development of the sector and the countries in general in the IOC region?Artisanal fishers of the region are already contributing towards food security and indirectly alleviating poverty, thus helping the countries concerned in achieving the millennium development goals. Furthermore, they provide fresh fish to the local market for local consumers and the tourism industry. Note that in the region, basically all fresh fish landed comes from the artisanal sector, be it in Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, Comoros or Reunion island. Seychelles also have a fleet of semi industrial fishing boats contributing to the landings of fresh fish whilst in Mauritius a few semi industrial fishing boats are also landing fresh fish for local consumption. Hence, fishers are very much part and parcel of the development of the sector.As an example, landings from the artisanal sector in Mauritius are valued at around 2.4 million US$ and in Comoros it is estimated at around 45.7 million US$. So you can see the impact it has on saving in foreign exchange.Can you give us an insight on how you see the future of the organisation?The FPAOI will in the longer-term link with other similar organisations such as the CAOPA, CNFO, ICSF and others. By sharing experiences, I think we can better serve the fishing communities of our region. we would also like to see a more sustainable artisanal fishery in the region and closer collaboration with the fisheries authorities and other RFMOs in the South West Indian Ocean.The main issue I see is the funding of the organisation, but we are seeking solutions. I am confident that the FPAOI has much better days ahead. Our aim is to raise the level of fishers including their income and contribute more to the development of our respective countries and the region in the broader sense.The task ahead is not easy, but we have a good team and determination to succeed.
