					<a name="eztoc1235242_1" id="eztoc1235242_1"></a><h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope of dairy production in the Caribbean</h2><p>The main dairy producers in the Caribbean region are Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Dominican Republic. Among the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Trinidad and Tobago has emerged as the leading dairy producer, overtaking Jamaica and Guyana, which dominated regional production up until the early 1990s.</p><p>Caribbean countries have traditionally hosted dairy industries that were pivotal to the supply of fresh milk to domestic markets, and the region’s dairy industry is still dominated by a large number of small-scale producers using a mix of hand and machine technologies for milking. Feeding systems also vary, and usually include a mixture of pasture or concentrate, and cut-and-carry systems (where feed is cut/gathered close to the cattle).</p><p>Domestic milk production in Caribbean countries is very closely linked to government food procurement programmes, mainly national school feeding programmes (SFP). This linkage is evident in Guyana, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Barbados, among others. An expansion in national SFPs fuelled not only the increase in imported milk powder, but also an improvement in consumer-ready milk packaging, most notably Tetra Pak packaging technology. Nestlé Trinidad and Tobago Ltd first initiated production of evaporated milk in Tetra Pak packaging in 1989, a new product concept developed with the assistance of their technical advisers.</p><p>According to press reports from the region, within the framework of globalisation and liberalisation, the policies of multinationals such as Nestlé Jamaica, which has steadily reduced local buying over many years while increasing imports of milk solids, have meant that developments in the global dairy industry are replicated in the local Caribbean dairy sector. Nestlé has subsidiaries in Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. In these countries, Nestlé is the main stakeholder in dairy processing operations. Barbados is the main Caribbean milk producer where Nestlé does not play a role.</p><p>The Caribbean dairy industry is dominated by fresh milk production, with a range of dairy by-products, including milk drinks and yoghurt. Local production of dairy products generally falls short of domestic demand for fresh milk and processed products.</p><p>The shortfall of local production has traditionally been met through imports of milk powder for processing from the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark and the United States of America, as well as other countries, although imports of liquid product are increasingly common, including ‘fresh’ ultra-heat treated (UHT) and other milk drinks.</p><p>These imports have been growing steadily in all Caribbean countries, aided in large measure by government policies to enhance access to ‘cheap foods’. Notwithstanding high production costs and operational efficiency considerations, trade liberalisation is widely blamed by Caribbean milk producers for the big contraction in the size of domestic dairy industries in all Caribbean dairy producing countries. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, local milk production fell from 52% of consumption to 27% between 2000 and 2010. This can be taken as indicative of a general trend across the Caribbean.</p><a name="eztoc1235242_2" id="eztoc1235242_2"></a><h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Caribbean dairy industry and trade liberalisation</h2><p><b>In Jamaica:</b> The Jamaica Dairy Development Board and Beef and Dairy Producers’ Association of Jamaica openly stated in 2009 that ‘the Jamaican dairy sector has undergone severe attrition, consequent to the adoption of a policy of trade liberalization in 1992, resulting in milk production declining 64 percent to current levels bordering on 14 million litres per annum.’ From the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Jamaican farmers saw their market share for local milk slip from 24% to 4.2%, and between 2000 and 2002 alone, production of liquid milk fell by 35%, from 27.5 million litres in 1999 to 20.5 million litres in 2002. These developments have taken place at the same time as Nestlé Jamaica, which was established in Jamaica in the late 1940s, has been changing its procurement practices. Traditionally, Nestlé Jamaica was the major purchaser of fresh milk, but the company has steadily reduced its local buying while increasing its imports of milk solids.&nbsp;</p><p><b>In Trinidad and Tobago: </b>The Livestock and Livestock Products Board (LLPB), while lamenting inadequate government support to the industry, has consistently blamed milk powder imports as the main cause of the rapid decline in milk production. Supply of milk&nbsp;from dairy farmers was estimated to have declined from 11,000 metric tonnes to 2,000 metric tonnes over the period 2009–2011. With only one of four established dairy stations (milk collection centres) operational, the LLPB forecasts continued decline in milk production for the local market.</p><p><b>In the Dominican Republic:</b> A similar outcome was reported for the Dominican Republic, where the rising demand and substantial increase in consumption in the 1990s was met by and fuelled a dependence on increasing quantities of ‘cheap’ imported dairy products. From 1974–75, when the importation and rehydration of powdered milk by processing companies was permitted (prior to this, all imported powder had to be sold as powder), domestic milk production has since either stagnated or experienced slow growth relative to imports. Reconstituting subsidised, imported powdered milk is seen as cheaper than collecting milk from producers throughout the country, especially given the widely dispersed farms and poor road infrastructure.</p><p><b>In Guyana:</b> In 2004, local production accounted for less than 5% of domestic demand. The country at that time had only one processing plant, the St Stanislaus College Farm, processing a range of products, including yoghurt and cheese. Since 2004, demand for products made from fresh cow’s milk has been increasing steadily, driving an expansion in the dairy industry and an increase in the number of value-added dairy products from an increased number of small scale pasteurisation plants.</p><p><b>In Barbados:</b> The local dairy consists of the lone domestic processor, Pine Hill Dairy (PHD), a subsidiary of Banks Holdings Ltd. Despite the high tariff applied on milk, imports continue to expand gradually. This reflects moves towards the removal of non-tariff barriers in line with WTO requirements. Import licences, although still in place, are granted automatically, while non-tariff measures were essentially converted to tariffs in 2000, with tariffs having been progressively reduced between 1995 and 2004. While high tariffs on fresh milk imports to a certain extent muted the impact of trade liberalisation on local production, national milk output in Barbados fell from 14 to 7 million kg between 1991 and 2012. Indeed, global dairy sector developments appear to be putting increasing pressure on the Barbadian dairy sector, processors and producers alike.</p><a name="eztoc1235242_3" id="eztoc1235242_3"></a><h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Caribbean dairy trade regime</h2><p>According to the EC market access database, there is considerable variation in the tariffs charged on dairy products by individual CARIFORUM countries (ACP members of CARICOM and the Dominican Republic). Within CARICOM, duties range widely (see table).</p><p><b>Table: Examples of tariffs charged on dairy products</b></p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

These tariff concessions either marginally reduce duties, or where duties are already low (e.g. 5%) waive the import duty. However, dairy products are generally excluded from the process of market opening within free-trade area (FTA) negotiations, with exceptions for specific products in some countries.</p><p>Almost all extra-regional dairy imports originate in the USA, Canada and UK, in that order. Jamaica is the only Caribbean country with regular purchases of dairy products from France.</p><p>Milk powder continues to dominate imports, accounting for roughly one-third of total dairy imports, with a long-term trend towards increased milk powder imports. However, imports have been highly variable over the past 11 years, with sharp dips in imports linked to high global prices.</p><p>Within CARICOM, only Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados are major suppliers of the main dairy products.to the rest of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).</p><a name="eztoc1235242_4" id="eztoc1235242_4"></a><h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current dairy sector challenges: The case of Pine Hill Dairy in Barbados</h2><p>Pine Hill Dairy (PHD) describes itself as a ‘market leader in Barbados, [a] presence in CARICOM’. In order to maintain its leadership in a ‘mature and competitive market place’ characterised by ‘low consumption of freshly produced cow’s milk’ where ‘chilled products are the preferred choice’ compared to ‘UHT white milk’, PHD states that it recognised the need for change. The company’s strategy was to ‘revitalise the category by differentiating, whilst maintaining affordability for the consumer’ through innovative processing, packaging and distribution solutions linked to its strong brand image. A key solution was the move to an ultra-pasteurised process, alongside the use of Tetra Gemina Aseptic packaging.</p><p>&nbsp;In 2010, to improve efficiencies and yields and increase the quality of products, in order to compete in a liberalised market (both domestic and regional), PHD invested B$14.2 million (approx. €5.48 million) in a major re-engineering project to consolidate its two production facilities – dairy and juices – into one. The consolidated facility was described as one of the ‘most modern and automated facilities in the region’. Production of the new ‘ultra-pasteurised’ milk commenced in May 2010. After an initial adverse consumer reaction, sales figures became more encouraging.</p><p>The PHD brand has already achieved regional recognition, and with product improvements under way, further regional export growth is anticipated. In 2009, the markets of Antigua, St Lucia and Guyana together accounted for 73% of PHD’s milk and juice export sales, compared to a mere 9% export market share for Trinidad. Exports to Trinidad and Tobago have become particularly problematical, with food safety and labelling requirements leading to the closure of the Trinidad and Tobago market to the new PHD milk products using Tetra Gemina Aseptic (TGA) packaging. With no similar actions taken in other CARICOM countries, this was seen by Barbadian exporters as a ‘discriminatory non-tariff barrier’. In July 2012, it was announced that the issue was being resolved, with the Trinidadian authorities having ‘agreed to allow the Barbados company to sell its existing “disputed” packaging of evaporated milk, fresh milk and flavoured milk, until it could change the labels’. In return, ‘Pine Hill Dairy (PHD) had agreed to change its “non-compliant” labelling within six months’. This is seen as opening up new export opportunities (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="http://agritrade.cta.int/en/Agriculture/Topics/SPS-Food-safety/Food-trade-dispute-between-Barbados-and-Trinidad-and-Tobago-rumbles-on" target="_self">Food trade dispute between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago rumbles on</a>’, 3 September 2012).</p><p>However, this resolution did not come before local milk producers in Barbados were asked to cut back supplies by 30% to address the glut of milk which had accumulated on the local market. PHD had earlier factored in an increased production from local dairy farmers to allow the company to fully utilise its manufacturing capabilities and focus on export growth for an expanding range of dairy products. As part of this, in December 2010 PHD increased the price paid for fresh milk by 6.5% and then in July 2011 suspended the previous milk production quota system that it had operated.</p><p>In 2010–11, Barbadian dairy farmers came under increasing pressure from high input costs, notably animal feed and growing competition from low-priced milk powder imports. This cast a shadow over an otherwise optimistic outlook, given the investment in dairy processing that had taken place. This left Barbadian dairy farmers poorly placed to cope with the current market crisis and led to stark warnings from the president of the Barbados Dairy and Beef Producers Association that if purchases of fresh milk were cut back, there would be ‘no industry by the end of the year’.</p><p>Overall, despite the investments made and the proactive strategic market repositioning adopted, 2011 was described by PHD as an extremely challenging year, with sales revenues of B$59.14 million (approx. €22.83 million), down 5.8% over 2010, with a loss of B$6.65 million (€2.57 million) for the year reported.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc1235242_5" id="eztoc1235242_5"></a><h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of the Caribbean dairy sector situation</h2><p>The Governments of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana have all established that the local dairy industry is essential to food and nutrition security, employment and rural incomes in their respective countries. However, despite the efforts of dairy farmers, local processors and governments, by the end of 2011 the dairy industry in Caribbean countries, particularly local fresh milk production, was described as one of crisis, with dwindling profits, shrinking markets, no incentives and a lack of clear rules for the management of milk powder imports.</p><p>For example, in the Dominican Republic, milk producers affirmed in September 2011 that their sector was ‘near the brink of collapse’, and in Trinidad and Tobago, a director of the Livestock and Livestock Products Board described the local dairy industry in December 2011 as being ‘in crisis’, with ‘a constant decline both in milk production and the supply of beef for the local market’, adding that ‘imported milk powder was largely responsible for the decline in milk production’.</p><p>Beyond the problem of effective management of milk powder imports, the regional dairy sector continues to be plagued by rising input costs and high levels of inefficiencies. Nevertheless, the view prevails in the region that there are still good prospects for local fresh milk production if efficient, vertically integrated operations can be established, targeting key market components. Wider self-sufficiency in dairy product manufacturing based on locally produced fresh milk supplies is, however, seen as largely impractical in most Caribbean dairy-producing economies.</p><p>For a more limited dairy economy that stabilises and maintains domestic fresh milk production to be maintained, the right mix of domestic and trade policy measures will be required, backed up by technological innovation and clear marketing and sector development strategies. At the interface of technology and public sector interventions, this will need to address such agro-economic issues as land utilisation, improving pasture management, and strengthening the genetic basis of the dairy herd to improve yields. More widely it suggests a need for a review and evaluation of the various industry-led and public policy measures in place to ensure the establishment of the right policy mix at national and regional levels.</p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td width="633" valign="top">  <p><b>Developing integrated dairy production</b></p><p>The Beef and Dairy Producers Association of Jamaica (BDPAJ) has proposed a ‘cluster model’ deemed to offer the best available option for future dairy industry development, built on integrating small farmers into a large farm model. The model incorporates small farmer investment in professionally managed nuclear farms and the adoption of non-traditional financing approaches (within the local context), such as capital (equipment) leasing and cow-leasing. Indeed, for Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean, the concept of cow-leasing, which has become popular in countries such as Argentina, New Zealand and the United States, will certainly be a novel industry development strategy.&nbsp;</p>
