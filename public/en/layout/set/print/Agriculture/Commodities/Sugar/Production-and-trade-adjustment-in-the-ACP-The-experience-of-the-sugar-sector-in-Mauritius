					<p><b><i>Q: What changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in market developments, or in your country’s trade relationship with the European Union (EU) required your industry to undertake production and trade adjustments?</i></b> </p><p>The modalities of the sugar price cut resulting from the reform of the EU sugar regime were finalised towards the end of 2005 – a 36% price cut, staged over a period of four years starting from July 2006. That was a major, unprecedented blow, but we were somehow already prepared to deal with it and with the growing threats on the Sugar Protocol.</p><p>Back in 2005 actually, Mauritius was already taking stock of its first Sugar Sector Strategic Plan 2001-2005, and was in the process of initiating its second accelerated reform plan. In fact the country – since 1991 – had already initiated a fully fledged Bagasse Energy Development Programme, which saw the first 64 MW coal-bagasse cogeneration plant coming into operation in January 2000. The erosion of preferential access on our traditional export markets for sugar, and the challenges imposed by the trade liberalisation process, had already called for very early action within the industry.</p><p>The industry reform plan of 2001-2005 was itself strongly motivated by the coming into force of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative and was actively pursued under the pending threat of the outcome of the European Commission (EC) sugar dispute. By April 2006, Mauritius had already submitted its new Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy 2006-2015 containing bolder and more ambitious measures. </p><p><i><b>Q: What were the main elements of the adjustment strategy that your industry pursued?</b></i></p><p>Our adjustment strategy had to be elaborated in a very particular context, coined as the triple shock – continually rising oil prices, the dismantling of the Multi Fibre Arrangement in January 2005, and the 36% sugar price cut. Any adjustment by the industry could not be proposed in isolation from the rest of the economy: optimising the full potential of the sugar cane biomass and providing a stronger competitive edge to our sugar exports were to be explored as key objectives for our country’s advancement. The mainstreaming of sustainable development concepts into our national strategies and actions also came in as an active proponent of sustained sugar cane cultivation on more than a third of the island’s surface area.</p><p>The main elements of our adjustment strategy were very simply expressed: reduce costs, seek for additional revenue, optimise sugar co-products and maintain a pro-poor approach throughout. These entailed as main measures an acceleration of the mill centralisation process from 11 to four mills by 2015, right-sizing manpower both at field and factory levels, substantially reducing the cost base of the industry by doing away with long-lived overheads, moving up the value chain from traditional raw sugar, promoting green energy sources, and implementing socially acceptable, and somewhat attractive, retrenchment plans.</p><p><b><i>Q: What role did support from the government play in assisting your industry in making the necessary production and trade adjustments?</i></b></p><p>Government is a major stakeholder in our sugar cane industry. Together with our operators, it relentlessly promotes and defends the export interests of the industry and it fully plays its role as a regulator and facilitator on all aspects that are linked to production activities. </p><p>Government therefore actively participated in the elaboration of the adjustment strategy, promoting national objectives and facilitating stakeholder involvement and ownership. It went on to defend the adaptation strategy before the EC, both as part of a national Country Strategy Paper and as a mandatory step to secure accompanying measures. Government also approved factory closures and voluntary worker retirement plans, funded to a large extent by those accompanying measures and routed through national budget support. Most of all, the sugar industry reform was fully integrated into the overall economic reform intent, and each and every funding possibility was fully explored by Government for the benefit of the whole reform effort – there was no piecemeal approach, given the state of national urgency.</p><p><b><i>Q: What role did EC assistance play in supporting your industry in making the necessary production and trade adjustments?</i></b></p><p>The adaptation strategy has a total projected cost of around €675 million up to 2015; 80% of the scheduled funding is actually the commitment from the private investors through both equity and loan. The remainder, some €138 million, is coming from EU accompanying measures and in fact split between €94 million for retirement packages for workers, and €44 million for incentive and support schemes for small growers.</p><p>Mauritius is actually expecting an overall total of around €301 million as EU accompanying measures. The €138 million mentioned above therefore account for 46% of these EU accompanying measures. The difference (€163 million, i.e. 54%) is going to Government’s central budget.</p><p><b><i>Q: How would you describe your experience of EU support to the adjustment process which your company/industry has undergone?</i></b></p><p>EU support has so far been a key determinant in our reform process. Beyond the funding received from the accompanying measures, the support provided in all aspects – defending the adaptation strategy, providing the required flexibility in the workings of disbursements versus conditionalities or performance indicators, and sharing the successful achievements – reflects commitment of the highest quality.</p><p><b><i>Q: How successful have the adjustments your industry has undertaken been in positioning yourself for competitive production and trade?</i></b></p><p>We are still very much in the early days. We have moved into value-added sugars from the traditional raw for refining supplies. Our first refined sugar consignments have reached our EU customers at the beginning of this year. Efforts to optimise the sugar cane biomass are on course as new additional electricity generation projects and new ethanol production investments await final negotiations with the regulatory bodies. We have realigned all our production resources and cut down significantly on costs, and we are pursuing our mill centralisation programme.</p><p>There is still a lot to do, namely providing support to smaller and more vulnerable growers as well as restructuring some of the older industry-funded service providing institutions. But we can boast some strong sense of self-satisfaction.</p><p><b><i>Q: What are the major challenges which you feel are faced in the future?</i></b></p><p>The attractiveness of our export markets has to be maintained, that is, their profitability and their levels of sophistication compared to our competitiveness. Our market competitiveness has to be strengthened in spite of our growing production costs. The end of the current EU Sugar Regime is also around the corner. Threats to Mauritius as the traditional main ACP sugar exporter to the EU are persistent.</p><p>On the local side, potential value-addition routes are attractive and many. These come to challenge many of the tried and tested policies that have guaranteed the success of our industry during the Sugar Protocol years. New value redistribution modes therefore have to be devised in a very complex environment – so, there is still a lot to do.</p><p><b><i>Q: What is your overall view of your industry’s future trade relationship with the EU?</i></b></p><p>At the outset, we can say that the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is a formidable trade gateway, with its duty-free, quota-free access to EU markets.</p><p>With regard to sugar, the recent change is a revolution on its own. And our adaptation strategy helped in changing our long-standing commodity supplier mindset into a food industry actor mode. Our trade relationship with the EU as from there can only improve. </p>
