			<h1>EU to expand out-of-quota sugar exports</h1>

			
			<h4>
												02 March 2010
										</h4>

					</header>


		
		
					<p>In January, in response to industry pressure following an exceptionally good sugar beet harvest, the EC announced its intention of allowing the export of a further 500,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar in the 2009/10 marketing year (to 31 July 2010). According to Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel, ‘the current situation on the world market is exceptional’, with world market prices ‘currently at record levels, well above the market price for EU quota sugar’. This, it is argued, allows EU out-of-quota sugar to be exported without any need for export subsidies or cross-subsidisation, meaning that exports can take place above the WTO ceiling for export-refund-supported exports ‘without violating the EU’s WTO subsidy commitments’. This is seen as a one-off action, since it is considered that ‘the present market situation for sugar is very unlikely to occur again in the future’. </p><p>The Brazilian sugar industry has objected to this EU move, describing it as ‘short-sighted’, since it will further encourage EU beet production. It called for the EU to seek approval from WTO sugar-panel members before implementing the measure. Indeed, the Brazilian, Australian and Thai governments are considering the joint filing of a case against the EU at the WTO in response to the announcement of a further 500,000 tonnes of EU out-of-quota sugar exports. The EC maintains that its decision is legal, since the high world market prices (with refined sugar trading at US$734/tonne in London compared to an EU reference price of US$569/t) and the unusual global shortage mean that EU producers can export without any need for cross-subsidisation (i.e. productions costs of EU sugar producers are below the current world market price). The EC is reported both to have sought legal advice before launching the initiative and to have received assurances that the measure in no way violated the ruling of the 2005 WTO panel (WT/DS265) which defined what constituted subsidisation of exports. </p><p>Brazil’s ambassador to the WTO however argues that the nature of the EU sugar regime means that all its sugar production is subsidised, and Australian trade negotiators for their part maintained that this view was endorsed by the previous 2005 WTO ruling. However, since the EU has ‘not released any data that would enable WTO members to make an assessment of the cost of producing sugar in the EU’, the debate seems likely to continue. </p><p>The concerned governments have sought to argue that the EC decision was largely responsible for the 15% decline in sugar prices which has occurred since the announcement. However, reports from the World Association of Beet and Cane Growers (WABCG) suggest that this impact may not have been so marked, with the white premium having risen to US$135/tonne in recent weeks, and white sugar prices rising from €528/t to €543/t in the week 5 to 11 February. While raw sugar prices fell from €462/t to €442/t over the period 1 to 11 February, a stronger US dollar may have countered some of the losses this implied for individual national currencies (except for the Brazilian real).</p><p>To date, although the three governments that are most concerned have taken the issue to the WTO, they are holding back from taking retaliatory action against the EU, preferring to continue negotiations with the EC with the aim of resolving the issue. </p><p>Despite the current dispute, the EC argues that sugar sector reforms have been a success, since they have encouraged ‘high-cost producers to stop production and growers in regions not adapted to beet growing to switch to more profitable crops’, thereby enhancing ‘the overall competitiveness of the EU sugar sector’. According to industry sources, some 800,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar is potentially available for export.</p><p>It should be noted however that at the same time as the EU is allowing the export of a further 500,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar, it is also preparing a regulation to allow ‘the duty-free import of 400,000 tonnes of sugar from the world market to be possibly used by the chemical industry in 2010/11 to ensure the long-term raw material supply planning for this sector’. In addition, ‘access to raw sugar to be refined under CXL import quotas’ (the MFN quota for raw cane sugar opened initially for Brazil and Cuba following Finland’s accession to the EU in 1995) is to be ‘facilitated by the suspension of the requirement to present export certificates from Brazil, Australia and Cuba for imports from these countries in 2009/10. A certificate of origin will be sufficient.’ </p><p>In response to the high level of German refined sugar production, press reports indicate that German farmers are planning to reduce sugar beet plantings. However, the granting of permission for a further 500,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar export licences is likely to reduce the contraction in sugar beet plantings from 10% to about 5%-6%. This season German production of refined sugar was 4.4 million tonnes (up from 3.7 million tonnes on the preceding season), some 1.51 million tonnes above its EU quota of 2.89 million tonnes. This situation resulted from an expansion in planting, exceptional beet yields, and a high sugar content.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The EC announcement of authorisation to EU producers to export 500,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar needs to be seen against the background of existing EU sugar exports of 1.35 million tonnes, following the increase of 650,000 tonnes on 5 November 2009. This in turn needs to be seen in the context of a WTO ceiling on EU exports of subsidised sugar of 1.37 million tonnes. The key question of course is whether these new EU sugar exports are subsidised or not. This at its heart raises the issue of production and trade effects of EU direct-aid payments to farmers. Any challenge in the WTO to the EU’s newly announced authorisation would inevitably compel the WTO to look closely into the production and trade effects of EU direct-aid payments made under the single payment scheme. This raises systemic implications for the basis of the EU’s CAP reform. The ramifications are thus profound. </p><p>More narrowly, however, any successful challenge to EU support systems arising from out-of-quota exports would be likely to stimulate further reforms involving additional reductions in the guaranteed ‘safety net’ price, in order to provide a disincentive to sugar beet production in Europe in low-cost production areas: the need for such a ‘disincentive’ policy is highlighted by the scale of out-of-quota sugar production in Germany. German sugar production is currently more than 52% above its EU production quota, and the country’s planned reductions of 5%-6% in the area under beet under current conditions will have little or no impact on the overall scale of its out-of-quota production. </p><p>If the EU were no longer able to use direct-aid payments to support European farmers, then this would imply a fundamental rethink of the overall process of CAP reform, including the use of traditional trade policy tools, such as export refunds, tariffs and tariff rate quotas, all of which could have implications for ACP producers. In addition, such profound changes would be likely to influence the process of price formation for ACP sugar beyond 2012, if further reductions in the EU sugar reference price were introduced as part of the 2013 round of CAP reforms. </p>
