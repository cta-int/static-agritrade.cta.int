			<h1>The functioning of the banana supply chain</h1>

			
			<h4>
												28 January 2010

					<p>With price wars breaking out between Britain’s leading supermarkets, banana prices are being cut dramatically. The Daily Telegraph website notes that ‘prices of bananas are being cut from 98p to 77p per kilo’, a reduction of some 22.5%. This comes on the back of price developments in the UK, which, according to analysis from Banana Link, ‘stripped more than half the total value out of the banana chain’ in 2009. While retailers claim that cheap bananas are ‘not at the expense of producers and intermediaries, as the cuts have come out of retail margins’, the question arises: will this continue to remain the case following the conclusion of the WTO deal? Fears are rising that once contracts come up for renewal, intensified price competition between supermarkets and the reduction on duties on Latin American bananas will ‘plunge banana growers into a race to the bottom’.</p><p>Analysis from Banana Link suggests that currently ‘prices paid to suppliers of UK supermarkets are one-third lower than seven years ago’. Banana Link highlights the rise of the ‘buying power of the supermarket chains’, which is eclipsing the former power of the big banana companies. While in the past EU and national authorities have used competition investigations to rein in the market power of the big banana companies, ‘competition law has not yet evolved to contemplate abuses of buying power at the top of the supply chain’. </p><p>In this context, it should be noted that the EC confirmed that in December 2009 it had ‘sent a Statement of Objections under anti-trust rules to a number of companies active in the import and marketing of bananas, concerning their alleged participation in a cartel’. According to press reports, the unidentified companies were in southern Europe, and this followed on from ‘surprise inspections’ carried out by the EC in November 2007. According to the reports, this follows actions last year which resulted in the EC ‘[fining] banana importers Dole and Del Monte for running a cartel’, while Chiquita ‘escaped fines because it blew the whistle on the illegal price fixing in northern European nations’.</p><p>In a press release issued on 17 December, Dole Food Company confirmed that the Statement of Objections issued by the EC did not affect any of its subsidiaries, and that it had maintained good cooperation with the EC in the process leading up to the issuing of the Statement of Objections.</p><p>Banana Link is arguing for a rethinking of price formation in the banana supply chain and looks to the work of the ‘fair trade’ movement for the basis on which this might occur. This would involve using calculations of ‘sustainable costs’ as the basis for price formation in the banana sector. This is seen as essential, since the current retailer ‘price wars’, over-supply situation and pending implementation of the banana deal are all likely to put pressure on the ‘fair trade’ model of price formation, even giving rise to a ‘race to the bottom’ among ‘fair trade’ suppliers as supermarkets chase cheaper ‘fair trade’ bananas. The significance of this issue is illustrated by the fact that, despite wider trends, the ‘fair trade’ minimum price for bananas has risen 21% since 2006 (with additional price premiums for organic bananas). </p><p>Banana Link is looking to the new World Banana Forum as a vehicle to promote broader use of ‘sustainable cost’ pricing as the basis for price formation in the banana sector. Against this background the ‘fair trade’ labelling and certification agency, FLO, plans to organise round tables in 2010 designed to promote the idea of ‘sustainable cost’ pricing. It is argued, however, that moves towards such a basis for price formation will require a review of the current retailer practices which it says are ‘stripping value out of the whole chain from the top down’. </p><p>Meanwhile, press reports in January noted complaints from Suriname’s banana-exporting company that for the second year running they were being offered ‘unreasonably low prices’ by their Dutch importer. This is despite improvements in the food safety and quality of bananas supplied following a five-year restructuring programme designed to lay the basis for full privatisation of the local banana sector. As a consequence a new Dutch importer is being sought. </p><p>With price wars breaking out between Britain’s leading supermarkets, banana prices are being cut dramatically.

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Between 1991 and 1999, banana prices in the UK fell 30% in real terms. A decade later, considerable price volatility is a feature of the UK banana market, with prices occasionally up to 35% below the nominal price level in 1991. </p><p>In the context of press reports on the impact of such pricing practices by UK supermarkets for bananas, and the pending erosion of the value of traditional ACP preferences, the EC action in sending out a Statement of Objections under anti-trust rules would appear to reinforce the need to launch a wider, joint investigation with ACP authorities into the functioning of the banana supply chain, and also to look into the practical measures which can be taken under the Banana Accompanying-Measures Programme to strengthen the market position of ACP banana suppliers within supply chains serving the EU market. The launching of joint competition investigations with ACP authorities on the functioning of the ACP-EU supply chain, particularly on this product, would offer a practical example of the benefits which ACP producers could gain from ACP-EU collaboration on competition issues. </p>
