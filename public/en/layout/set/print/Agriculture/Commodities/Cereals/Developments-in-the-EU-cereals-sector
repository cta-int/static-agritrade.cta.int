			<h1>Developments in the EU cereals sector</h1>

			
			<h4>
												04 April 2010
										</h4>

					</header>


		
		
					<p>A series of evaluations and reviews of developments in cereals sub-sectors under the impact of CAP reform have been posted. In February 2010 the USDA posted a review highlighting the dramatic change which has taken place in the EU’s position on the global barley market. At the turn of the century, the EU dominated global barley trade with over half of all exports (some 10 million tonnes). By 2009/10, the new exporters of Ukraine and Russia accounted for nearly half of global exports (48%) and the EU’s share had fallen to 8.9% (some 1.5 million tonnes). The review noted that the EU’s dominant position had been sustained by high domestic prices that stimulated production and large export subsidy programmes, which allowed EU markets to be cleared. Reduced support prices and a corresponding decline in EU market prices stimulated domestic use while the EU reduced its use of export subsidies, reducing the EU’s market dominance at a time of rising exports from non-traditional suppliers. In future the elimination of intervention support for barley is expected to reduce the acreage under barley and reduce the exportable surplus still further. Indeed, EU exports are projected to fall by 500,000 tonnes to the lowest level in six years.</p><p>The EC-financed evaluation of the durum wheat sector paints a similar picture. Between 2003/04 and 2006/07 the area under durum wheat fell from 4.1 million hectares to 3.0 million hectares, with the subsequent price boom only marginally boosting land allocated to durum wheat production (up to 3.1 million tonnes). This saw EU27 production decline from 12,628,000 tonnes in 2003/04 to 8,521,000 tonnes in 2006/07, before recovering to 10,156,000 tonnes in the 2007/08 season (compared to 10,093,000 tonnes of production prevailing in the 1999/2000 season).</p><p>As gross margins on durum wheat diminished, so production declined. However with the price surge of 2007/08, gross margins recovered and production rose again, suggesting a stronger market orientation to EU durum wheat production.</p><p>To date the reform process has not brought about the hoped-for improvement in the quality of durum wheat production. Overall ‘the reform of the CAP has led to little structural change’, with trends already apparent before the reform process, namely the expansion of farm size merely having continued.</p><p>Significantly the report concluded that in the absence of support, the area under durum wheat would fall a further 18% if prices reverted to 2006 levels, or 4% if prices and costs stayed at 2008 levels. It further noted that with the decoupling of payments, farmers’ incomes had been stabilised and their dependence on the returns from any particular crop had been reduced.</p><p>The report concluded that:</p>
<ul>

<li>EU durum wheat production is now more market-oriented, with EU prices moving in line with world market prices;</li>

<li>the phasing out of coupled support in 2010 will lead to a further reduction of the area under wheat;</li>

<li>the competitiveness of the EU durum wheat sector has been maintained;</li>

<li>producer incomes have been maintained;</li>

<li>there has been no change in employment in value-added processing, although farm employment in some areas has fallen as a result of the reforms;</li>

<li>the environmental impact of the reform process has been neutral.</li>

</ul>
<p>The evaluation of the hops sector notes that the EU accounts for 80% of global exports and 50% of global imports of hops, but with the EU’s market share diminishing due to the rise of US and Chinese suppliers. While gross margins on hops are high compared to other products, the number of EU growers is declining. The EU hops sector therefore needs to address competitiveness issues. Hops are very important in some countries, but generally form part of mixed farming arrangements. The EU hops sector has for many years been market driven, with its evolution closely linked to trends in beer production. The reform process has therefore had little impact. In general a continuation of current policies is advocated.</p><p>These evaluations do not cover the period of price slump that followed the price surge. These more recent developments have caused major concern to EU farmers. According to EU farmers’ and agri-cooperatives’ organisation COPA-COGECA, ‘EU grain prices have plummeted by 45% over the past two years whilst production costs have risen sharply by 63% over the period 2004-2009’. Farmers’ organisations argue that this has given rise to a ‘disastrous situation’, with cereals production set to fall in 2010/11. COPA-COGECA Secretary-General Pekka Pesonen argues that ‘this disastrous situation demonstrates the need to improve market management measures under the CAP’, so as to better ‘enable farmers to withstand crises’. He called for an examination of measures in four specific areas: safety nets; market risk management; export promotion and the functioning of the supply chain, in order to strengthen the position of producers.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The EC-financed evaluations highlight how EU farmers’ production decisions now largely reflect market price trends, although not market price <i>per se</i>. Production decisions are equally influenced by a reduction in farmer dependence on revenues generated by the sale of crops produced, arising from the effects of the single payment scheme. This more ‘market-oriented’ approach is a direct consequence of the decoupling of support. However, as the durum wheat evaluation pointed out, EU support payments still influence the overall areas placed under cereals crops such as durum wheat.</p><p>The hops sector is somewhat different, with its close connection to trends in the brewing industry making it much more market driven. Overall however EU production is shifting to what markets demand rather than what specific production subsidies encourage. Nevertheless, the area under crops and overall production are strongly influenced by the overall level of public sector support extended via the single farm payment. This being stated, EU policies are increasingly being designed to reduce the impact of price instability on the agricultural base, while patterns of agricultural production across the EU are shifting towards those areas most suited to the production of specific crops. Broad underlying policy objectives are thus being attained, even if all specific objectives have not yet been attained. As a result, farmers’ leaders are far from happy with the effectiveness of EU ‘safety net’ policies and are pressing for additional measures.</p><p>The long-term implications of these developments for the ACP-EU trade relationship are far from clear. With regard to cereals sector development, perhaps one of the most important areas of impact relates to the relative attractiveness of cereals and sugar beet production for EU farmers. If cereals production becomes more attractive to EU farmers, the transition to a production-quota free EU sugar regime would be facilitated. This could create a situation where national sugar production quotas are removed without any need for a further reduction in the EU reference price for sugar.</p><p>What is clear is that with the shift to decoupled support, production patterns within the EU will increasingly be driven by the relative prices of different agricultural commodities on EU markets, and not the different levels of product-specific aid available under EU support schemes. This implies a need for increased flexibility and market responsiveness of the part of ACP producers and traders, as EU prices fluctuate in the light of global and EU production and price trends.</p>
