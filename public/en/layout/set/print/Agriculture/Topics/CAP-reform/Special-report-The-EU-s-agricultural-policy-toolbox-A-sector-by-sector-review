Why the changing use of EU policy tools is important to the ACP</b></p><p>The changing use of European Union (EU) agricultural policy tools in individual sectors carries important implications for the EUâ€™s trade position and its agricultural trade relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries. It also potentially has a bearing on the agricultural component of ongoing trade negotiations in a number of ACP regions.</p><p>This arises from the fact that the use of these EU policy tools impacts on:</p>
<ul>

<li>the area under production or the numbers of animals under production; </li>

<li>prices on EU markets for the agricultural products concerned; </li>

<li>overall levels of production in the EU; </li>

<li>EU patterns of trade in agricultural products; </li>

<li>in some sectors, international price formation.</li>

</ul>
<p>It is in this context that the following special report, reviewing the use of EU agricultural policy tools sector by sector, has been compiled. First, however, it is necessary to set the scene with a brief overview of the evolution of the EUâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) since 1992.</p><p><b>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overview of CAP reform since 1992</b></p><p>The process of CAP reform since 1992 has involved a shift in policy focus away from European agricultural self-sufficiency, towards serving a globally oriented, value-added food and drinks industry. This has seen a gradual, yet fundamental, reform of the policy tools used to manage the European food and agricultural sector.</p><p>Initially, EU agricultural policy was based on incentive prices, designed to stimulate production and secure European food supplies. This required the establishment of a range of price support tools and associated measures (for example, establishing intervention prices required the creation of intervention agencies, the finance of storage programmes and surplus disposal programmes, while minimum grower prices gave rise to a system of processing aids for agro-processing companies) and a protective trade policy, consisting of high levels of tariff protection and various import restrictions.</p><p>Since 1992, the EU has been moving from a system of price support to a system of direct aid to farmers. This system has been progressively decoupled from the production of specific agricultural commodities. This basic change has impacted on the use of a wide range of agricultural policy tools.</p><p>The aim of these changes has been to make EU food and agricultural products more competitive vis-Ã -vis third country producers, both on domestic EU markets and increasingly internationally. Thus we find that lowering intervention prices, while expanding direct aid payments, has allowed EU market prices to fall closer to world market price levels without undermining farm incomes and land utilisation, and hence EU production levels. Indeed, in some sectors production has even expanded in the face of dramatic price declines.</p><p>Falling EU market prices have expanded domestic EU demand for a range of agricultural commodities, as well as making it easier for the EU to clear markets. It is this development, rather than dramatic reductions in EU production levels, which in many sectors has seen EU surpluses disappear.</p><p>The closing of the gap between EU and world market prices has impacted on how the EU uses traditional agricultural policy tools in various agricultural sectors. This closing of the gap between EU and world market prices has been aided in recent years by surges in global food and agricultural commodity prices, in large part driven by expanding consumer demand in rapidly growing advanced developing countries (mainly in Asia).</p><p>These developments came as no surprise to the European Commission, which had long before projected the shifting pattern of global consumer demand. What has come as a surprise has been the level of price volatility, a development which has thrown up new challenges. This increased price volatility, coupled with a growing exposure of EU producers to the influence of world market price trends, has given rise to a growing policy focus on developing effective â€˜safety netsâ€™, to prevent price volatility from undermining the agricultural basis for production of affected commodities within the EU.</p><p>This is impacting on the use of traditional agricultural policy tools â€“ not only financial support tools, but also agricultural trade policy tools. It has also given rise to the development of new policy initiatives, as the process of reform towards more market-oriented patterns of agricultural production have thrown up new problems (e.g. new policy initiatives to strengthen the functioning of supply chains, to prevent inequalities in power relationships along supply chains from undermining agricultural production during periods of price declines).</p><p>The process of reform has been very gradual, with reforms being rolled out in different sectors at different times over the almost 20 years of reform since 1992. These reforms are gradually reaching the culmination of the process, whereby the vast majority of EU agricultural assistance will be decoupled from the production of individual agricultural commodities, and the policy focus will have shifted from support through public subsidies for specific agricultural products to public support for investment in quality-differentiated, high-value food and agricultural production and marketing.</p><p>This latter policy orientation is being underpinned by a range of cross-cutting policies (e.g. the agricultural products quality policy) and rural development expenditures under Axis 1 of the EUâ€™s consolidated rural development. Despite this orientation towards a single payment scheme, backed up by an expanding rural development fund, the situation regarding the use of EU agricultural policy tools still varies from sector to sector.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Table 1: The EUâ€™s evolving CAP policy toolbox</p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

The 2005 reform package merged the â€˜Aâ€™ and â€˜Bâ€™ quotas and sought to cut the combined production quota by 6 million tonnes. However it also allowed major producers of â€˜Câ€™ sugar (see section 2.4 below) to â€˜buyâ€™ additional quota allocations of 1.1 million tonnes.</p><p><b>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€˜Out-of quotaâ€™ or â€˜Câ€™ sugar</b></p><p>Companies are allowed to produce beyond their production quotas, but this out-of-quota sugar (also known as â€˜Câ€™ sugar) cannot be sold for food purposes on the EU market. This â€˜Câ€™ sugar could be:</p>
<ul>

<li>carried over to the next season; </li>

<li>exported within WTO ceilings with the benefit of export refunds; </li>

<li>exported without export refunds </li>

<li>since July 2006, be sold to the EU ethanol, chemical and pharmaceutical industries for non-food uses.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reference prices</b></p><p>Since 1 October 2009, the EU reference price for raw sugar and white sugar has been â‚¬335.2/tonne and â‚¬405.4/t respectively, having been reduced by 36% as part of the November 2005 reforms. In November 2010, the average market price for white sugar price was â‚¬486/t, while for industrial sugar (â€˜Câ€™ sugar) it was â‚¬326/t.</p><p><b>2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intervention buying and private storage</b></p><p>Intervention buying was maintained during a 4-year transition period (up to October 2010), with support for private storage being introduced to provide a â€˜safety netâ€™ in case market prices fell below the reference price. This is financed under budget item 05020508. No expenditures were made under this heading in 2009 and 2010. Indeed, the EU gained a net income from these operations in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>Table 2.6.1: Appropriations and outturns (in â‚¬)</p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p>The EU also has recourse to a <b>special safeguard clause.</b></p><p>A variety of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) are in place which allowed reduced tariffs or duty-free access, depending on the price and the supply situation. TRQ access for sugar under bilateral free-trade area (FTA) agreements is expanding. Depending on the outcome of the Doha Round, the EU may need to expand its autonomous WTO TRQ by an additional 500,000â€“850,000 tonnes.</p><p>Provision also exists for <b>inward processing arrangements</b>, with duty-free imports allowed for use in the manufacturing of value-added products that are to be exported.</p><p><b>2.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Import licences</b></p><p>Import licences are required for sugar to be imported into the EU.

The overall level of licences to be issued is decided on by the CAP management committee. Export licences are partly linked to WTO agreed ceilings on export refund support to sugar exports. In a context of high world market sugar prices, the issuing of export licences for unsubsidised out-of-quota sugar exports has become an issue of some controversy.</p><p><b>2.14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Export refunds</b></p><p>The EU continues to maintain export refund support in the sugar sector. This consists of export refunds for sugar and isoglucose (Item 05020501) and production refunds for sugar used in the chemical industry (Item 05020503).

<p><b>10.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tariffs</b></p><p>For poultry products, the EU applies a highly disaggreggated system of fixed duties per 100 kg of imports (although for some categories a percentage duty is applied). The specific duties vary considerably from product to product, from a low of â‚¬187/tonne to a high of â‚¬1,024/tonne, with a wide range of levels in between. The highest duties are on products entering those market components where EU poultry producers have the greatest commercial interest and where the competitive challenge is potentially greatest.</p><p>In addition the EU has established a range of preferential duty free quotas. The following preferential quota rate for Brazil and Thailand is illustrative:</p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p><b>10.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional policy dimensions</b></p><p>EU poultry sector developments have been strongly influenced by EU cereals sector reforms, with this having given rise to a substantial reduction in poultry sector feed costs. This provided a major stimulus to the expansion of EU poultry production and exports.</p><p>EU exports of poultry parts were also strongly influenced by the introduction of a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal in animal feed. This removed a major domestic market for poultry parts and saw a rapid expansion of exports of poultry parts to ACP countries, particularly in West Africa.</p>
