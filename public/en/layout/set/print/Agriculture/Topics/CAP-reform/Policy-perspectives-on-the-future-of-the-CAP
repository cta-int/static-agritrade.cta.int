			<h1>Policy perspectives on the future of the CAP</h1>

			
			<h4>
												01 March 2011
										</h4>

					</header>


		
		
					<p>The EC has posted a series of four policy briefings on the future of the CAP:</p>
<ul>

<li>Brief No. 1, first published in December 2009 and now revised, looks at policy developments since 1992 and the challenges for the future CAP;</li>

<li>Brief No. 2 looks at the future of the direct payments scheme; </li>

<li>Brief No. 3 looks at the future of CAP market measures; </li>

<li>Brief No. 4 looks at the future of rural development policy.</li>

</ul>
<p>In terms of the future of direct-aid payments, two perspectives are noted: one sees the system as ‘a necessary basic income support for farmers’, while the other believes that payments should provide compensation for the provision of specific public goods. The Commission reconciles these two views by stressing that basic income support for farmers enables them to deliver important public goods. The introduction of ‘cross compliance requirements’, which link payments to respect for basic rules, is seen as an important means of reconciling these two perspectives.</p><p>A second area of debate relates to the distribution of direct-aid payments across the EU27, with an historical inequality between payment levels for farmers in EU15 and EU12 countries. While there are exceptions to this general rule, nevertheless this gives rise to large differences in the overall importance of direct-aid payments within farm income, from a high of 70% in Denmark, to a low of 2-8% in Malta and Cyprus. For EU15 farmers the average is 31%, and for EU12 farmers 19%, with an overall average of 29% for the EU27.</p><p>It is widely recognised that these inequalities should not be allowed to continue. In this context, the challenge is seen as being to manage the transition to a more equitable system, without disrupting existing patterns of agricultural production, which would lead to land abandonment. It is argued here that ‘an equal distribution of direct support may not necessarily be the same as an equitable distribution.’ The briefing acknowledges that changes to the direct-aid payment scheme need to be seen in the context of the other policy tools used (including rural development spending) and should not be discussed in isolation.</p><p>Reforms to date, involving a shift from price support to producer support, are held to have promoted a greater market orientation in farmers’ production decisions. However this raises the issue of how to deal with the heightened price volatility, which is increasingly transmitted from global to EU markets. This is a major focus of the briefing on the future of CAP market measures.</p><p>Price volatility is seen as an increasing challenge due to:</p>
<ul>

<li>‘an increasing integration of global commodity markets with financial markets’; </li>

<li>‘a closer link between energy markets and agricultural markets’; and </li>

<li>the growing impact of climate change on agricultural production across the globe. </li>

</ul>
<p>It is noted that ‘stabilising farmers’ incomes is no longer … [about just] stabilising the prices farmers receive. … [It has to take] into account also the cost side of the income equation.’ It is feared that rising costs and price volatility, given the risk-averse nature of many farmers, may be generating an under-investment in agriculture, which will eventually undermine the basis of agricultural production in the EU at a time of rapidly rising global demand. It is against this background that increased policy attention has been paid to the design of ‘safety nets’, to prevent periodic crisis situations undermining the production base, while at the same time ensuring that EU price movements reflect global price movements.</p><p>The recent experience in the dairy sector is held to be illustrative of the continued importance of intervention schemes. This is held to be particularly the case, given the moves under way to phase out the use of production quotas as a market management tool.</p><p>New policy tools being explored include measures to strengthen the functioning of the specific supply chains. While this approach was first developed in the dairy sector, Brief No. 3 argues that it could ‘also be extended to other sectors’ to address problems ‘related to price transmission, bargaining power and transparency’.</p><p>In terms of addressing the consequences of increased price volatility, renewed interest is being shown in:</p>
<ul>

<li>stock-holding policies at national, regional and the global level; </li>

<li>support to farmer-based schemes for risk management (via insurance subsidies); </li>

<li>income-stabilisation schemes (a possible alternative to the current direct payment support). </li>

</ul>
<p>The policy challenge is held to be striking the right balance between:</p>
<ul>

<li>the use of new and traditional policy tools; </li>

<li>the use of targeted programmes or general programmes; and </li>

<li>simplicity and cost-effectiveness. </li>

</ul>
<p>It is recognised in Brief No. 4 that the future of the EU’s rural development policy will be strongly influenced by the outcome of the budget debate, with the scope for the use of ‘modulation’ being limited under a large-scale downsizing of expenditures under Pillar 1 of the CAP. The broad direction of reforms to date is endorsed (a three-axis approach, financed from a single fund – the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development [EAFRD] – with implementation taking place in a highly decentralised manner, given the huge diversity in EU rural areas). However it is considered in the policy brief that far greater emphasis needs to be given to the cost-effectiveness of interventions in terms of delivery on stated policy objectives. A key policy objective under EU rural development programmes is ‘enhancing agricultural competitiveness’ (‘Axis 1’). In this area, it is thought that if budgetary constraints become acute, consideration may need to be given to shifting from grant-financed interventions to the provision of subsidised loans.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>One area not discussed in the policy briefs is the external effects of EU direct-aid payments and market support measures. The EC has acknowledged that direct-aid payments play an important ‘safety net’ role in assisting EU farmers in dealing with price instability transmitted from global markets. It is also held that the recent EU dairy-sector experience highlights the continued need for traditional policy tools, such as intervention buying. Yet questions arise: if these measures helped to sustain EU dairy production, prevented global price declines from undermining the basis for EU milk production, and enabled EU dairy processors to take advantage of the subsequent market recovery, to what extent did they displace sector adjustments from the EU level to the global level? And to what extent did this process of ‘adjustment displacement’ adversely impact on ACP economies?</p><p>From an ACP perspective, a critical question is how to contain the negative external effects of the EU’s use of a range of safety-net policy tools which can displace the adjustment costs of price downturns to non-EU markets. The fact that the EU’s new policy tools, and its evolving use of traditional policy tools, may be judged to be less trade disrupting does not remove the need to address the adverse external effects which may arise from their deployment. Greater policy attention needs to be paid first to identifying the limited number of areas where the deployment of EU policy tools could adversely impact on ACP producers, and then developing mechanisms for the management of the use of these tools in ways that minimise negative effects on ACP producers.</p>
