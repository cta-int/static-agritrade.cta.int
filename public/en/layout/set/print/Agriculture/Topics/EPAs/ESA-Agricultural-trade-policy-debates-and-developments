					<a name="eztoc496940_1" id="eztoc496940_1"></a><h2><b>1. Introduction and overview </b></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>1.1 Agricultural production</b></p><p>The importance of agriculture and agro-processing varies greatly across Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA), ranging from 2% of GDP in Seychelles to 51% in Ethiopia, and accounting for between 10% (Mauritius) and 90% (Burundi and Rwanda) of employment (averaging 70% across the region). From a food security perspective, in Mauritius only 5% of the population is undernourished while in Burundi and Eritrea undernourishment affects 62% and 64% of the population respectively (and ranges elsewhere from 22% to 43%). Overall, production of the main food crops in the region is insufficient to meet consumer needs, although some countries generate periodic surpluses (e.g. Malawi). Many countries in the ESA region are vulnerable to drought.</p><p>Agriculture is dominated by small-scale producers, but large-scale commercial farms play a significant role in countries such as Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania. Livestock production is spread across the ESA group, but dominates in the north, while maize production dominates in the southern countries, and rice in Madagascar. Apart from Madagascar, island states have limited agricultural opportunities. Bananas and plantains represent important food security crops in many of the countries, and commercialisation of production is a growing priority.</p><p>2010 was a very good year for coarse grain production in ESA countries, and record harvests of coarse grains were recorded in some countries following extensive input supply programmes (e.g. in Malawi). The 2011 season has been affected by drought, leading in some instances to export bans (Tanzania) and appeals for the waiving of import taxes in maize (Kenya). Resorting to these unilateral trade policy tools, in the face of drought and threats of famine, potentially poses problems for regional trade integration in the food and agricultural sector (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Commodities/Cereals/Maize-trade-policy-decisions-highlight-need-for-closer-regional-policy-harmonisation" target="_self">Maize trade policy decisions highlight need for closer regional policy h...</a>’, July 2011).</p><p>The relative importance that should be attached to agricultural production and the manufacturing of value-added food products is potentially an important area of contention within the ESA configuration. For example, Mauritius imports around 70% of its food and agricultural input requirements, and its policy is oriented towards the production of value-added food products. This leaves Mauritius favouring export subsidy programmes in certain OECD countries for certain agricultural raw materials, and this therefore influences Mauritian perspectives on rules of origin issues.</p><p><b>1.2 Agricultural trade</b></p><p>In terms of trade, the ESA region is poorly integrated. In 2009 only 2.6% of total trade occurred between ESA member states. Some 5.9% of agricultural trade however took place between ESA member states. There is considerable variation in the extent of intra-ESA trade between products. Sectors with higher rates of intra-ESA agricultural trade include: beverages and spirits (22%); coffee, tea and spices (15%); and sugar and milled cereal products (12%).</p><p>There is also considerable variation between sub-regions. Within the East African Community (EAC), some 7% of agricultural trade occurs between EAC member states, with the rate much higher in meat and edible offal (32%); live animals (30%); dairy products (30%); beverages and spirits (26%); and sugar and sugar confectionery (10%).</p><p>Within the ESA grouping Kenya is both the main agricultural exporter (26% of the total) and the main agricultural importer (18.3% of the total). As an important transportation hub, Kenya is also at the heart of intra-regional trade. Within the smaller EAC grouping, Kenya’s economic dominance has traditionally been a matter of political concern.</p><p>The ESA region’s main agricultural exports include tea, coffee and spices (23.3%); tobacco (14%); horticultural products (17.1%); cotton (4.4%); and increasingly sugar (6.1%). In the past 15 years, export-oriented horticultural production has developed significantly, while in the past 10 years substantial new investments have been made in the sugar sector and associated value-added processing activities.</p><p>The main agricultural product imports are: cereals (31%); animal and vegetable fats and oils (16%); and sugar products (7%). In the northern zone of the ESA region, dairy products and processed tomatoes are also significant imports.</p><p>Considerable scope exists for the development of intra-regional trade in basic cereals. This is a sensitive issue, with a wide variety of trade policy tools being deployed on food security grounds (from export bans to import restrictions linked to quality standards). Addressing food availability concerns in an era of rising prices and increased vulnerability to climate-related events poses a significant regional policy challenge. Yet facilitating intra-regional trade, so that food can move freely from food-surplus to food-deficit areas, can be seen as a critical response to these challenges.</p><p>In the sugar sector, with the decline in EU preferential prices, regional markets are now looking increasingly attractive to ESA producers, with increased regional trade evident (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Commodities/Sugar/Regional-sugar-trade-and-production-in-Eastern-and-Southern-Africa-growing" target="_self">Regional sugar trade and production in Eastern and Southern Africa growing</a>’, July 2011). Considerable investment is taking place in the expansion of sugar production in ESA member states (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Commodities/Sugar/Investments-under-way-to-expand-ESA-sugar-production" target="_self">Investments under way to expand ESA sugar production</a>’, May 2011). Certain ESA sub-regions are net sugar importers, with a policy orientation towards self-sufficiency (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Commodities/Sugar/ESA-Investments-under-way-to-prepare-for-regional-free-trade-in-sugar" target="_self">ESA: Investments under way to prepare for regional free trade in sugar</a>’, March 2011), yet the region as whole is a net sugar exporter. This could potentially generate trade conflicts (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/ESA-Clock-ticking-for-Kenya-s-sugar-industry-under-regional-market-opening" target="_self">ESA: Clock ticking for Kenya’s sugar industry under regional market opening</a>’, February 2011).</p><p>Beyond issues of intra-regional trade, coffee represents a potential area for regional cooperation on marketing of single-origin coffees, with considerable potential for the development of greater value-added processing and packaging in the coffee sector (modelled on the ‘authentic Caribbean rum’ programme).</p><p>Horticulture also represents an area for intensified cooperation in reducing the costs of SPS and food safety compliance, and developing intra-regional trade in horticultural products.</p><p>In the cotton sector, meanwhile, initiatives are under way to strengthen the functioning of the supply chain to provide greater income stability to primary producers. Considerable scope exists for regional cooperation on policies to strengthen the functioning of supply chains, potentially providing low-cost, sustainable solutions to problems related to the commercial viability of smallholder farming systems.</p><p>The EU is the main agricultural trade partner of the ESA region, providing a market for 42.8% of the ESA group’s food and agricultural exports and 15.7% of the region’s food and agricultural imports. South Africa is also an important supplier, particularly to countries in the southern part of the ESA region. These points are important in the evolving discussions on the conclusion of a tripartite free-trade area (FTA) agreement, including the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the EAC (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/ACP-FTAs/Road-map-for-trilateral-FTA-agreed" target="_self">Road map for Trilateral FTA agreed</a>’, August 2011).</p><p>China is growing in importance as an export market. A critical issue facing the region is whether the emergence of China as a competitor for the region’s food and agricultural exports can be exploited to attract investment in value-added processing which will move regional production up the value chain (e.g. expanding coffee roasting and packaging facilities, and local tea blending and packaging) (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../Africa%20urged%20to%20diversify%20and%20structurally%20transform" target="_self">Africa urged to diversify and structurally transform</a>’, July 2011). In this context, India’s renewed interest in intensifying economic collaboration with Eastern and Southern African economies could also offer scope for attracting investment in moving up the value chain (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/India-looks-for-increased-trade-and-economic-cooperation-with-Africa" target="_self">India looks for increased trade and economic cooperation with Africa</a>’, July 2011).</p><p><b>Table 1: ESA countries’ main sources of agricultural imports and agricultural export markets (2008–2009, in US$ millions)</b></p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p>Source: compiled by the author</p><p>The fact that governments have multiple, overlapping membership of these regional trade bodies means that coordinating agricultural trade policy at a regional level is made highly complicated. Efforts are underway to harmonise these regional trade arrangements through the establishment of a ‘grand’ tripartite FTA (T-FTA).</p><p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that four countries are members of COMESA but not part of the ESA grouping. These are:</p>
<ul>

<li>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC is a part of the Central Africa negotiating configuration for EU Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs).</li>

<li>Swaziland, which is a member of SACU and also the SADC EPA configuration.</li>

<li>Egypt and Libya, which are non-ACP states that together account for over half of the GDP of COMESA.</li>

</ul>
<p>However the most basic complicating factor arises from the differing national policies on the use of agricultural and agricultural trade policy tools.<b> </b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><a name="eztoc496940_2" id="eztoc496940_2"></a><h2><b>2.

Indeed, livelihood concerns can come to dominate policy formulation.

FAO, 2005–07.</p><p>Despite the efforts under way to bring about regional coordination, agriculture and agricultural trade policy remain a national responsibility. Governments have different perspectives on what constitute appropriate policy tools for the promotion of agricultural development and the relative importance to be accorded to the use of specific tools. Some governments favour the use of financial support measures, such as input subsidy programmes, as a means of promoting agricultural development in key sectors. Other governments favour the more extensive use of trade policy tools to promote the development of specific sectors. Most governments deploy a combination of financial support instruments (mainly input supply programmes) and trade policy tools.</p><p>Building consensus on what agricultural trade policy tools can be used, and how they can be used, is likely to prove a difficult task. This is made more difficult by the conflation of the use of trade policy tools with discussions on the elimination of other non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) (such as cumbersome customs administration procedures; divergent technical standards; illegal transport control points; logistical infrastructure constraints and the serious problems of transportation constraints). It is important to make a distinction between these non-tariff obstacles to trade and the transparent and accountable use of trade policy tools within an agreed regional policy framework.</p><p><b>Table 4: Policy related non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade among ESA countries</b></p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p>Source: Extracted from World Bank, Africa Trade Policy Note No. 9, November 2010</p><p><b>2.2 Agriculture and agricultural trade policy in the COMESA</b></p><p>The aim of COMESA is to promote sustainable economic growth to improve the living standards of the people of the region through cross-border cooperation. This is to be promoted through the establishment of a customs union with a common external tariff and the abolition of all non-tariff barriers to trade between members (including quantitative or like restrictions or prohibitions, and administrative obstacles to trade). However, provision is made for infant industry protection, special safeguards (nominally limited to one year, but renewable) and collaboration on sector policies, including agriculture. Anti-dumping provisions and rules dealing with domestic subsidies are also included in the COMESA Treaty.</p><p>COMESA’s provisions on agriculture include commitment:</p>
<ul>

<li>to cooperate in agricultural development; </li>

<li>to harmonise agricultural and agro-industrial development policies with a view to establishing a common agricultural policy; </li>

<li>to enhance regional food sufficiency; </li>

<li>to cooperate in the export of agricultural commodities; </li>

<li>to cooperate in agricultural research and extension; </li>

<li>to enhance rural development.</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition to cooperation in a range of technical areas, commitment is made under the COMESA Treaty to strengthening farmers’ participation in agricultural development, including in the areas of marketing, input and service provision, risk management and training. Commitment is also made to the ‘replacement of imports on a regional basis’ and ‘the coordination of the export and import of agricultural commodities’.</p><p>However, according to the COMESA website, opening up agricultural trade flows by eliminating all barriers to trade and putting in place regionally harmonised policies, systems, regulations and procedures are central to COMESA’s vision.</p><p>COMESA has adopted a largely programme-based approach to the elaboration of its agricultural policy ‘in line with the broader Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme’ (CAADP). A growing number of ESA member state governments have committed themselves to the CAADP, which is a programme of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). By March 2011, 11 ESA group members were engaged with the CAADP process: seven members had signed CAADP compacts, six of which had already prepared their investment plans.</p><p>This is indicative of the growing policy focus on developing agricultural production following the food price crisis of 2007/08. The CAADP seeks to increase government expenditures on agriculture to 10% of a country’s total budget, aimed at attaining annual agricultural sector growth of 6%. The CAADP provides the main framework for the extension of external assistance to agricultural development in Africa.</p><p><b>2.3 Agriculture and agricultural trade policy in the SADC</b></p><p>While the SADC is committed to the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, this is tempered by a recognition that some existing agricultural trade policy tools can play an important role in attaining wider development policy objectives. Against this background a pragmatic approach has been adopted in the SADC Trade Negotiations Forum.</p><p>Under the SADC Trade Protocol a distinction was made between elimination of non-tariff barriers such as import quotas, customs procedures and export subsidies, where commitments were sought, and such non-tariff measures as local content requirements, levies and other border charges, and import and export licensing arrangements, which were excluded from the process of removal of non-tariff barriers, providing that such measures were minimally trade distorting.</p><p>At the SADC level it is recognised that a careful assessment needs to be made before taking decisions on individual non-tariff measures.</p><p>While functional cooperation in the agricultural sector has been part of the SADC programme since 1980, and efforts to harmonise policy date back to the 1990s, substantive work on establishing the national baseline for the development of a regional agricultural policy began in March 2008. A synthesis report on key agricultural policy issues was drafted and subjected to technical discussions in April 2010. Here the importance of having a formal, legally binding common agricultural policy was agreed. Technical work is now underway to clearly articulate:</p>
<ul>

<li>the policy visions, goals and principles of such a policy;</li>

<li>the policy interventions to be permitted and the conditions for their use;</li>

<li>the implementation arrangements for the management of the regional agricultural policy.</li>

</ul>
<p>A regional agricultural policy document is expected to emerge in 2012, with political approval being secured at key ‘milestones’ in parallel with this technical work (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/Moving-forward-SADC-s-regional-agricultural-policy" target="_self">Moving forward SADC’s regional agricultural policy</a>’, July 2011).</p><p>This SADC process includes 6 of the 16 ESA group members (Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Seychelles, Zimbabwe and Zambia), 2 further members of COMESA (Swaziland and the DRC) and 1 member of the East Africa Community Customs Union (Tanzania).</p><p><b>2.4 Agriculture and agricultural trade policy in the EAC</b></p><p>The implementation of the East African Community Customs Union commenced in January 2005 (among Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), with Rwanda and Burundi joining in 2007. To accommodate different levels of development, a 5-year transitional period for the dismantling of tariff protection was agreed for LDCs. Member states are on course for the implementation of these transitional arrangements.</p><p>Commitments to the elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade were also made. A 2009 evaluation found that NTBs ‘remain a serious obstacle to trade within the region’. Most of the NTBs highlighted however were administrative and regulatory, rather than trade policy-based tools. A considerable agenda of issues for the facilitation of intra-regional trade is currently being addressed. Serious challenges remain, however. For example, divergent national standards are particularly severely felt in the dairy sector.</p><p>In terms of trade policy tools, the government of Tanzania maintains restrictions on exports of certain food and agricultural products (e.g. cereals and beans), on food security grounds. These range from the periodic introduction of export bans, through the use of export taxes and export licensing arrangements. Uganda and Kenya also prohibit exports, but to a lesser degree than Tanzania.</p><p>A three-band common external tariff (CET) is in place (0% for raw materials and capital goods; 10% for intermediate goods; 25% for consumer goods). However a further category of sensitive products was agreed on which the CET could exceed 25%. 58 sensitive products fall within this category including some major agricultural items. These higher tariffs range from 35 to 100%. Provision is made for member states to apply lower import duties on request. For example, in May 2011 Kenya sought duty-free access for maize imports. However this causes concerns about trade diversion and smuggling within the customs union.</p><p>Since the launch of the customs union in 2005 there has been ‘a steady increase in intra-EAC trade’. Intra-EAC trade in agricultural products is highly seasonal and largely informal. There is a huge trade imbalance between Kenya and other EAC members, in part linked to the re-export trade.</p><p>In terms of agricultural policy under the EAC Treaty (2006) the main aim is to promote food security and achieve rational agricultural production. The ultimate aim is to establish a common EAC agricultural policy via progressive harmonisation of national policies.</p><p>While progress has been made in cooperation on a range of technical issues, in 2010 regional experts were still calling for the urgent creation of an EAC common agricultural policy. It was noted how regional trade in agricultural commodities was often resisted by national farmers’ groups with complaints of ‘dumping’. In this context it was felt that common rules were needed to ensure a level playing field between all agricultural producers within the EAC.</p><p><b>2.4 Recent developments in regional agricultural trade policy</b></p><p>The complexities arising from overlapping membership are recognised, and the launching of the initiative to establish the T-FTA is intended to address this problem. The initiative was formally launched at by the heads of state in October 2008 (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/EPAs/A-wider-eastern-and-southern-African-FTA-is-proposed" target="_self">A wider Eastern and Southern African FTA is proposed</a>’, January 2009).</p><p>At the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations of the formation of the SADC, the launch of a SADC customs union was postponed, while only a minority of COMESA members signed on to the COMESA customs union launched in Victoria Falls in June 2009. At the official opening of the 29<sup>th</sup> meeting of the COMESA Council of Ministers in December 2010, the beginning of 2012 was established as the new date for the establishment of a COMESA CET.</p><p>Moving over to a common external tariff in food and agricultural products is likely to prove particularly problematic, given the differing levels of protection of individual food and agricultural products across COMESA member states and the extensive use made by some COMESA members of special dispensations. These range from the exceptions granted to Kenya to maintain tariff protection for sugar until February 2012, and the blanket exceptions granted to Swaziland not to implement tariff reductions, given its membership of the SACU.</p><p>The establishment of a multiplicity of bilateral ‘simplified trade regime initiatives’, the launch of sector-based liberalisation initiatives (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/Agriculture-policy-discussions-highlight-importance-of-smallholder-farming-sector" target="_self">Agriculture policy discussions highlight importance of smallholder farmi...</a>’, July 2011) and the intensification of T-FTA discussions are all indicative of a pragmatic approach to regional trade integration. As part of the T-FTA initiative, the secretariats of the various existing regional bodies involved (EAC, SADC COMESA) have worked together to produce a draft agreement and technical annexes, and initial drafts had already been revised by December 2010 (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/EPAs/Trade-policy-Eastern-and-Southern-Africa-free-trade-area-starts-to-take-shape" target="_self">Eastern and Southern Africa free-trade area starts to take shape</a>’, October 2010).</p><p>This approach is based on ‘tariff-free, quota-free, exemption-free trade’, based simply on combining the existing FTAs, with sensitive lists and exemptions to be broadly eliminated by 2012 (a provision for limited exemption vis-à-vis big partners only is envisaged, with clear time limits being stipulated). The draft treaty includes a prohibition on the use of export duties, the elimination of all quantitative restrictions on imports and exports (including presumably export bans) and indeed all NTBs (including presumably the use of import and export licences). While safeguard and infant industry restrictions are included, these are strictly limited. A range of complementary initiatives is also envisaged, including infrastructure and service sector liberalisation. A 3-year timetable for the implementation of the first phase, trade in goods T-FTA, is envisaged.</p><p>However it should be noted that within the SACU, it has been agreed that the T-FTA process has to be member-state driven. In this context, texts prepared by regional secretariats are seen as inputs to the process, but not as the starting point for negotiations, which must remain member-state driven. Similar processes of internal consultations are under way in the EAC and COMESA.</p><p>It is widely recognised that if the T-FTA process is to succeed, widespread product exclusions and the maintenance of NTBs will need to be comprehensively addressed. This is likely to be a tricky issue in the agriculture sector. How do you minimise the level of product-specific exclusions, while taking into account the regional complexities which can leave markets functioning in ways that are to the detriment of producers in less developed economies? (See <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../Agriculture/Topics/EPAs/SADC-EU-EPA-negotiations-on-hold-as-grand-FTA-challenges-become-apparent" target="_self">SADC–EU EPA negotiation on hold as ‘grand FTA’ challenges become apparent</a>’, July 2011.) This is a critical policy challenge that will require in-depth consideration and analysis from government policy makers and concerned private sector operators.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><a name="eztoc496940_3" id="eztoc496940_3"></a><h2><b>3. Wider trade negotiations and developments</b></h2><p><b>3.1 The EPA negotiations</b></p><p>In terms of the EPA negotiations, governments in the ESA group fall into four categories:</p>
<ul>

<li>those that have initialled and signed a bilateral interim EPA (IEPA) and are already implementing their bilateral tariff phase-down commitments (Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Zimbabwe); </li>

<li>those that have initialled a bilateral IEPA but have not yet signed the IEPA, and are thus not yet implementing tariff phase-down commitments (Comoros, Zambia);</li>

<li>those that have collectively initialled an IEPA but have not yet signed, and hence are not yet implementing tariff phase-down commitments (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda);</li>

<li>those governments that have not yet initialled an IEPA (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Malawi, Sudan, Somalia).</li>

</ul>
<p>Countries that signed their IEPAs on 29 August 2009 are now expected by the European Commission (EC) to implement the agreed tariff phase-down commitments.</p><p>The EC has been continuing negotiations to allow the signing of all initialled IEPAs. The EAC has identified three main areas of contention:</p>
<ul>

<li>the implications of the provisions relating to export taxes in terms of their impact on the use of export taxes as a trade policy tool; </li>

<li>the implications of provisions related to the most favoured nation (MFN) clause; </li>

<li>the development cooperation provisions of the IEPA, specifically the absence of provisions related to production adjustment support.</li>

</ul>
<p>In parallel with negotiations over the signing of initialled IEPAs, the EC has been conducting a process of negotiations aimed at establishing a comprehensive regional EPA. By July 2011, a comprehensive ESA EPA had not been concluded.</p><p><b>3.2 Other trade negotiations</b></p><p>Beyond the engagement with the T-FTA process, COMESA is not involved in trade negotiations with third parties. A similar situation pertains to the SADC, where trade negotiations with third parties remain the prerogative of member states. In May 2011, India indicated that it was looking to establish ‘a joint study group to explore the modalities for an FTA with COMESA’ (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/India-looks-for-increased-trade-and-economic-cooperation-with-Africa" target="_self">India looks for increased trade and economic cooperation with Africa</a>’, July 2011).</p><p>In terms of the EAC Customs Union, beyond the EPA negotiations and the T-FTA negotiations the EAC is not involved in any other plurilateral processes of trade negotiations. In 2011 however the pace of accreditation of third countries to the EAC Secretariat accelerated suggestions that in the coming period a number of countries may seek to launch consultations over possible trade agreements.</p><a name="eztoc496940_4" id="eztoc496940_4"></a><h2><b>4. Current agricultural trade policy debates and issues</b></h2><p><b>4.1 Establishing a consensus on agricultural policy</b></p><p>Within the ESA grouping and particularly in the context of the T-FTA, there are divergent views on regional agriculture and agricultural trade policy issues. Some implicitly argue for a gradual pragmatic approach, with common policies being allowed to emerge from the process of coordination and cooperation. Others argue for the development of regional policies that should take precedence over national policies.</p><p>Those who favour giving primacy to regional policies take the view that NTBs should simply be swept away. Those who favour a gradual approach believe that the regulated use of certain trade policy tools should be allowed so as to address the disparities in the scale of agricultural production and trade capacities of member states.</p><p>It is acknowledged that any changes to the approach to non-tariff barriers to trade (notably seasonal restrictions and import licences) would be likely to lead to very different production and employment patterns to those currently prevailing in the sectors subjected to such measures. This is why any consensus on regional agriculture and agricultural trade policy needs to be built from the bottom up.</p><p>Within the SADC grouping (6 of the 16 ESA members), a bottom-up approach to agricultural policy harmonisation based on existing national realities appears to be favoured. However it is essential that this process include in-depth consultations with stakeholders. Establishing effective networks of communication among national governments and stakeholders and regional bodies may serve to increase the willingness of member states to cede part of their sovereignty by allocating a greater coordinating role to regional institutions.</p><p><b>4.2 The future role of trade policy and financial support instruments</b></p><p>While in the wider region there is a critical debate under way on the future use of financial support instruments as opposed to trade policy tools, within regional secretariats there is a tendency to favour the systematic dismantling of all tariff barriers to trade. This is reflected in the draft text of the T-FTA agreement. This could prove controversial, given the continued use of trade policy tools in some countries as part of successful sector development initiatives. One way forward could be to ensure full transparency in the application of trade policy tools, within commonly agreed regional rules. A critical consideration in this regard would be ensuring that agricultural trade policy tools are used in ways which only minimally disrupt intra-regional trade, while securing the wider policy objective they are intended to serve.</p><p>Developing policy guidelines to improve the functioning of agricultural supply chains in the context of the trade dominance of a number of partner countries in the T-FTA area could form an important new complementary area for policy initiatives.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>4.3 The future basis of regional trade integration</b></p><p>The essential dichotomy in the region is between those who wish to focus on effectively making existing commitments operational in a pragmatic fashion, based on the current primacy of national policy making processes, and those who wish to push ahead with commitments to deepen economic cooperation and integration. This division can be found in its most acute form in the wider T-FTA grouping.</p><p>The ‘pragmatists’ seek to deploy the region’s human and institutional resources on consolidating existing arrangements and addressing fundamental structural constraints. The ‘regionalists’, in contrast, argue that by abandoning existing commitments to the creation of a SADC customs union, then momentum will be lost and regional integration will become mired in day-to-day disputes. In this context it should be noted that regional policy analysts have argued that ‘most of the economic gains from lower tariffs and improved trade facilitation do not depend on the creation of a customs union and could be gained from a thorough implementation of the current Trade Protocol and upcoming Free-Trade Area’.</p><p>Following the 2007/08 food crisis the ‘pragmatist’ approach appears to be gaining ground at both the SACU and SADC levels. However to avoid becoming mired in day-to-day disputes it is essential that stakeholders can be routinely and transparently incorporated into national and regional policy formulation processes. This will require considerable investment in building policies from the bottom up.</p><p>In addition, if the T-FTA process is to be member-state driven, then it is essential that clear and coherent domestic agricultural and agro-industrial policies are in place at the national level, which can then be harmonised at the regional level. In the absence of clear national policies in these areas, obstacles to expanding regional agricultural trade are likely to remain in place despite the nominal trade liberalisation commitments made.</p><p><b>4.4 Agricultural trade issues in the EPA negotiations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p>In June 2010 the ambassadors to Geneva of the EAC member states highlighted a range of specific provisions of concern in the IEPA. Concerns relating to agricultural trade included the need for:</p>
<ul>

<li>a more extensive list of ‘sensitive products’; </li>

<li>mechanisms for addressing import surges and EU export support issues; </li>

<li>enhanced cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and quality standards issues to reduce adverse trade effects;</li>

<li>a review of clauses dealing with standstill, export tax, MFN, and the prohibition of quantitative restrictions; </li>

<li>an elaboration of measures to address preference erosion concerns. </li>

</ul>
<p>(See <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/EPAs/Signing-of-EAC-EU-IEPA-deferred" target="_self">Signing of EAC–EU IEPA deferred</a>’, July 2010).</p><p>In addition, a considerable agenda of issues still needs to be addressed to consolidate the EAC customs union, as a number of these non-tariff issues have links to certain IEPA provisions (e.g. related to the use of export restrictions and import licensing) (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/EPAs/Further-delays-likely-in-signing-EAC-EU-EPA" target="_self">Further delays likely in signing EAC–EU EPA</a>’, January 2011).</p><p>While the situation varies from each ESA member to the next, these EAC concerns can be taken as indicative of the concerns of the governments that have not yet initialled or signed IEPAs.</p><p><b>4.5 Agricultural trade issues in other third-country agreements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p>In terms of trade relations with third countries, the ESA configuration would appear to have no immediate relevance. Negotiations are much more likely to be undertaken at the level of established customs unions (e.g. the EAC Customs Union), given that a common external tariff is in place, making tariff reduction negotiations much simpler. That said, major trading powers such as India are currently considering the launch of FTA negotiations with COMESA (see <i>Agritrade</i> article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/../../../../en/Agriculture/Topics/ACP-regional-trade/India-looks-for-increased-trade-and-economic-cooperation-with-Africa" target="_self">India looks for increased trade and economic cooperation with Africa</a>’, July 2011). It remains to be seen whether sufficient tariff harmonisation can be achieved in the coming years to make such negotiations practical, or whether the T-FTA process will be given precedence over moves towards a COMESA customs union.</p><p><b>4.6 SPS issues</b></p><p>In certain ESA sub-regions SPS-related restrictions have severely affected the development of regional trade, in the absence of coordinated regional strategies to contain serious plant diseases (for example in trade in bananas and plantains). There is therefore a need to strengthen collaboration on SPS issues, both bilaterally and through regional bodies. However, this will require human resource constraints to be addressed across the region. It will also require increased investment in technical infrastructure (e.g. accredited laboratories and scientific research bodies), an area where COMESA has ongoing programmes under implementation. It further requires improved interaction with private sector stakeholders, in order to facilitate verification of compliance.</p><p>There have been some notable successes in efforts to assist ESA governments in getting to grips with SPS issues (e.g. in the horticulture sector). However the scale of the challenge faced cannot be underestimated, with political initiatives to promote greater regional trade (e.g. the recent seeds trade initiative) being held back by technical capacity constraints in harmonising regional standards.</p><p>Assistance has also been extended to ESA governments in engaging with the activities of international standard setting bodies. However, despite a commitment to adopting a collective approach in order to meaningfully influence international standards, participation on a regional level has not been coordinated. Finally, there is a vital need to harmonise the varied national legislation across the region with relevant international standards, in order to improve access to more favourably priced markets.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>4.7 Rules of origin issues</b></p><p>The rules of origin of COMESA and EAC are based on across the board percentage values and ‘Change in Tariff Heading’ (CTH) requirements. While initially the approach to SADC’s rules of origin mirrored this approach, in a SADC context these rules of origin were never fully implemented. A product-specific, line-by-line approach was adopted instead. This could potentially pose problems in the elaboration of the rules of origin under the proposed T-FTA.</p><p>In the ESA context, different positions on rules of origin issues can be seen to be related to differing national strategies for food and agricultural sector development. Countries such as Mauritius, with a limited agricultural base, place considerable policy emphasis on the development of price-competitive, value-added food product industries, based on imported inputs. In such a context, a simple CTH approach is favoured. Other countries with important agricultural sectors that provide inputs into the food and drinks sector tend to favour more product-specific rules of origin requirements, so as not to shrink ‘local’ industrial demand for agricultural raw materials.</p><p>Potentially this poses an important policy challenge in moving forward food and agricultural sector development and food and agricultural product trade in the ESA region.</p><a name="eztoc496940_4_1" id="eztoc496940_4_1"></a><h3><b>Main sources</b></h3><p>1.
