			<h1>Launch of the second phase of the negotiations</h1>

			
			<h4>
												20 May 2004
										</h4>

					</header>


		
		
					<p>
On October 4th 2003 the first regionally based second phase of the <br />
 &nbsp;EPA negotiations was begun between the EU and CEMAC - the Central <br />
 &nbsp;African Economic and Monetary Union - which includes Cameroon, Central <br />
 &nbsp;African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, <br />
 &nbsp;Sao Tome and Principe. On October 6th the second regionally based <br />
 &nbsp;second-phase negotiations were launched in west Africa with ECOWAS <br />
 &nbsp;-the Economic Community of West African States - which includes <br />
 &nbsp;Cape Verde, Guinea; Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and WAEMA <br />
 &nbsp;- West African Economic and Monetary Union - which includes. Benin, <br />
 &nbsp;Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire Guinea Bissau; Mali, Niger, Senegal <br />
 &nbsp;and Togo.<br />
 Speaking in Benin at the opening of the west Africa negotiations <br />
 &nbsp;EU Trade Commission Pascal Lamy maintained that the objective of <br />
 &nbsp;an EU-West Africa EPA was an ambitious one, namely 'transforming <br />
 &nbsp;West Africa into an economic hub which both attracts investment <br />
 &nbsp;and mobilises private initiative; a centre of economic activity <br />
 &nbsp;ensuring sustained growth... and long-lasting economic, social and <br />
 &nbsp;environmental development'. According to Commissioner Lamy this <br />
 &nbsp;is to be achieved through: widening existing markets; establishing <br />
 &nbsp;a stable, transparent and predictable framework for economic activity <br />
 &nbsp;and facilitating trade between the EU and west Africa.<br />
 With regard to market access, Commissioner Lamy expressed the commitment <br />
 &nbsp;to 'progressively eliminating trade barriers between us' and committed <br />
 &nbsp;the EU to building on existing preferences 'by getting you as close <br />
 &nbsp;as we can to the system we operate for the least developed countries'.<br />
 Referring to CAP distortions, Commissioner Lamy committed the EU <br />
 &nbsp;to discussing internally the impact of the EU's remaining export <br />
 &nbsp;subsidies as well as other measures that could act as barriers to <br />
 &nbsp;trade.<br />
 With reference to the extent of reciprocity, Commissioner Lamy <br />
 &nbsp;maintained that the Commission would 'carry out these negotiations <br />
 &nbsp;with all the flexibility necessary to take into account the economic, <br />
 &nbsp;social and environmental restrictions with which you are confronted, <br />
 &nbsp;as well as your countries' capacity to adapt to the process of freeing <br />
 &nbsp;markets'. He maintained that market opening would be required only <br />
 &nbsp;to the extent 'necessary for your own development'.<br />
 Commissioner Lamy recognised that EPAs would 'entail restructuring <br />
 &nbsp;your economies' but maintained that this was essential if the benefits <br />
 &nbsp;of EPAs were to be obtained. These benefits he maintained would <br />
 &nbsp;need to be policy driven. Commissioner Lamy emphasised the importance <br />
 &nbsp;of bringing into the process of EPA negotiations 'all concerned <br />
 &nbsp;stakeholders, be they the private sector social partners or civil <br />
 &nbsp;society' and maintained that the European Commission was committed <br />
 &nbsp;to supporting this process.<br />
 Commissioner Lamy acknowledged concerns about the preparedness <br />
 &nbsp;of west Africa to engage in EPA negotiations. He noted that while <br />
 &nbsp;ECOWAS was committed to the establishment of a common external tariff <br />
 &nbsp;by 2007, few practical steps to achieving this objective had been <br />
 &nbsp;taken. He also noted that 'many other measures still have to be <br />
 &nbsp;put into effect in order to achieve real economic integration at <br />
 &nbsp;west African level and even more measures to reach the objective <br />
 &nbsp;you have set yourselves of establishing a common market across west <br />
 &nbsp;Africa'. Commissioner Lamy pointed out that in west Africa the participation <br />
 &nbsp;of Nigeria and Ghana in the regional integration process and EPA <br />
 &nbsp;negotiations was essential, for without them regional integration <br />
 &nbsp;would not gather much momentum. Despite the problems faced, Commissioner <br />
 &nbsp;Lamy expressed the view that EPA negotiations would facilitate resolution <br />
 &nbsp;of these problems.<br />
 He reiterated the Commission's belief in 'open regionalism' whereby <br />
 &nbsp;alongside opening up towards each other, ACP countries would take <br />
 &nbsp;steps to open to the wider world (notably the EU). Commissioner <br />
 &nbsp;Lamy maintained that any other alternative to EPAs would be 'inconceivable <br />
 &nbsp;on a political level and irresponsible on an economic level'.<br />
 Development Commissioner Poul Nielson in his speech covered many <br />
 &nbsp;similar areas, emphasising that Phase 1 had succeeded in placing <br />
 &nbsp;development at centre stage in the EPA negotiating process. He maintained <br />
 &nbsp;that EPAs in and of themselves were a 'development framework', with <br />
 &nbsp;development being 'mainstreamed all over the process of 'building' <br />
 &nbsp;the EPA' and guiding discussions on every topic under negotiations.<br />
 Commissioner Nielson highlighted that under the EDF the EU has <br />
 &nbsp;a long-standing commitment to supporting regional integration amongst <br />
 &nbsp;ACP countries. This he maintained was reflected in the designation <br />
 &nbsp;of 'support to regional integration and trade' as a focal sector <br />
 &nbsp;throughout ACP regional indicative programmes.<br />
 Finally Commissioner Nielson emphasised the importance of EPAs <br />
 &nbsp;and development assistance being complementary. He referred to the <br />
 &nbsp;importance of using NIP funds, RIP funds and Investment Facility <br />
 &nbsp;resources to support the preparation and implementation of EPAs, <br />
 &nbsp;and recognised that this may require a review of the utilisation <br /> &nbsp;of NIP resources under the mid-term review process.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>
Market access<br />
 &nbsp;Commissioner Lamy's commitments on the market-access component of <br />
 &nbsp;EPAs are illuminating. He committed the EU to getting EPA members <br />
 &nbsp;'as close as we can to the system we operate for the least developed <br />
 &nbsp;countries' This implies that the market access arrangements to be <br />
 &nbsp;negotiated under EPAs will not provide market access as good as <br />
 &nbsp;the trade preferences extended to least developed countries under <br />
 &nbsp;the EU's 'Everything but Arms' initiative, the benefits of which <br />
 &nbsp;already accrue to 12 of the 14 west African countries which were <br />
 &nbsp;a party to the opening of the second phase negotiations (and 4 of <br /> &nbsp;the 7 central African countries).</p><table class="renderedtable" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="75%">

<p>
Economic Partnership Agreements would thus appear to offer no additional <br />
 &nbsp;benefits to the vast majority of west African countries in terms <br />
 &nbsp;of the tariff treatment accorded them for access to the EU market. <br />
 &nbsp;This means that overall with regard to market access, the benefits <br />
 &nbsp;which EPAs may bring will hinge on how the EU deals with non-tariff <br />
 &nbsp;barriers to trade, most notably SPS issues and rules-of-origin issues.<br />
 CAP reform<br />
 &nbsp;It may be significant that in addressing the external effects of <br />
 &nbsp;CAP reform Commissioner Lamy restricted himself to references to <br />
 &nbsp;export subsidies, ignoring entirely the effects of the new CAP-support <br />
 &nbsp;instruments on production and trade in ACP countries. The position <br />
 &nbsp;adopted by Commissioner Lamy is consistent with the Commission's <br />
 &nbsp;view that the new forms of support are either less trade distorting <br />
 &nbsp;or non trade distorting. Also of significance is the Commissioner's <br />
 &nbsp;reference to how the EU will 'discuss among ourselves' the issue <br />
 &nbsp;of export subsidies. This implies that the EU is not willing to <br />
 &nbsp;participate in a dialogue with ACP countries on the external effects <br />
 &nbsp;of the CAP.<br />
 Reciprocity<br />
 &nbsp;The Commissioner's comments on the extent of reciprocity which would <br />
 &nbsp;be required from west African countries were designed to reassure <br />
 &nbsp;governments that this would be consistent with what was necessary <br />
 &nbsp;for their development and their ability to adapt. However it needs <br />
 &nbsp;to be borne in mind that at the close of Phase 1 the Commission <br />
 &nbsp;reiterated its interpretation of WTO provisions on 'substantially <br />
 &nbsp;all trade' meaning that the product coverage of any reciprocal agreement <br />
 &nbsp;should extend to 90% of currently traded goods. This Commission <br />
 &nbsp;position would appear to place very real limits on the extent of <br />
 &nbsp;flexibility within which the Commission will negotiate reciprocal <br />
 &nbsp;market-access commitments. It reinforces ACP concerns over the need <br />
 &nbsp;for a modification of WTO rules on free-trade areas to accommodate <br />
 &nbsp;appropriate levels of reciprocity in trade relations between a developed <br />
 &nbsp;economic giant like the EU and a bloc of least developed and developing <br />
 &nbsp;countries such as those in west and central Africa.<br />
 Regionalism<br />
 &nbsp;The Commission's reiteration of the importance of pursuing 'open <br />
 &nbsp;regionalism' was linked by Commissioner Lamy to the establishment <br />
 &nbsp;of NEPAD and the importance of west Africa being open to trade with <br />
 &nbsp;other African countries in the context of NEPAD. However it should <br />
 &nbsp;be borne in mind that the EU's promotion of the concept of 'open <br />
 &nbsp;regionalism' dates back to the mid-1990s. Despite the difficulties <br />
 &nbsp;faced in fostering regional market integration in West Africa the <br />
 &nbsp;Commission asserts that open regionalism will ease these difficulties. <br />
 &nbsp;In its presentation of this point the Commission has a habit of <br />
 &nbsp;conflating the benefits of regional market integration with the <br />
 &nbsp;benefits of concluding free-trade area agreements (EPAs) with the <br />
 &nbsp;EU at the same time. This is highly contentious. The parallel negotiation <br />
 &nbsp;of EPAs may well dilute the benefits derived from the creation of <br />
 &nbsp;larger regional markets, since it may well result in local enterprises <br />
 &nbsp;sharing the benefits of larger markets with EU enterprises which <br />
 &nbsp;secure access to the enlarged market through EPA negotiations. In <br />
 &nbsp;a context where transport infrastructure, rather than linking up <br />
 &nbsp;regional trading partners, is primarily oriented to overseas trade, <br />
 &nbsp;the benefits of the creation of larger markets under 'open regionalism' <br />
 &nbsp;may come to be gained disproportionately by European-based enterprises <br />
 &nbsp;rather than those in neighbouring countries. <br />
 The development context<br />
 &nbsp;While in his speech to the assembled West African delegations Commissioner <br />
 &nbsp;Lamy made reference to the wider context within which Phase 2 EPA <br />
 &nbsp;negotiations will take place, this focussed exclusively on the WTO. <br />
 &nbsp;No reference was made to the all-ACP-EU follow-up mechanism, which, <br />
 &nbsp;from an ACP perspective, aims to both resolve the issues left outstanding <br />
 &nbsp;under the Phase 1 negotiations and provide a coordinating mechanism <br />
 &nbsp;to maintain the negotiating strength of the ACP Group as a whole. <br />
 &nbsp;This suggests a lack of EU commitment to the joint follow-up mechanism <br />
 &nbsp;established. Careful monitoring of the EPA negotiations will be <br />
 &nbsp;essential in order to ensure that the EU lives up to its commitment <br />
 &nbsp;to building development into all aspects under negotiation within <br />
 &nbsp;the EPA process.<br />
 Regional integration<br />
 &nbsp;Commissioner Nielson's emphasis on support to regional integration <br />
 &nbsp;conflates the EU's long-standing support to regional co-operation <br />
 &nbsp;with its increased focus on supporting regional market integration. <br />
 &nbsp;The extent of the increased Commission focus on regional market <br />
 &nbsp;integration can be seen from the fact that the guidelines for regional <br />
 &nbsp;programming prepared by the Commission had 'support to regional <br />
 &nbsp;integration and trade' already filled in as a focal sector for all <br />
 &nbsp;ACP regions. <br />
 EDF support<br />
 &nbsp;The emphasis on using EDF funds to support programmes for the preparation <br />
 &nbsp;and implementation of EPAs is a somewhat controversial area. The <br />
 &nbsp;first point to note is that the European Commission has a relatively <br />
 &nbsp;poor record of support to economic programmes. Put simply, the Commission <br />
 &nbsp;on the basis of its own evaluation reports, is simply not very good <br />
 &nbsp;at conceptualising, designing and implementing such programmes. <br />
 &nbsp;Secondly EDF procedures are poorly suited to responding to the time <br />
 &nbsp;frames of the private-sector operators which will increasingly need <br />
 &nbsp;to be brought into EDF cooperation programmes if successful support <br />
 &nbsp;to economic restructuring is to be extended. Thirdly only a small <br />
 &nbsp;amount of NIP resources has so far been allocated to trade, business <br />
 &nbsp;and agricultural development A review of the sectoral utilisation <br />
 &nbsp;of some &amp;euro;6,243 million of agreed 9th EDF NIP programmes found <br />
 &nbsp;only 0.1% of funds allocated to trade projects, only 0.6% allocated <br />
 &nbsp;to business projects and only 1.1% allocated to agricultural projects. <br />
 &nbsp;The vast majority of funds were allocated to structural adjustment <br />
 &nbsp;(30.7%), which largely took the form of budgetary support and transportation <br />
 &nbsp;projects (21.4%), with governance, water, education and health accounting <br />
 &nbsp;collectively for a further 25.2% of programmed allocated funds. <br />
 &nbsp;This suggest that if substantial amounts of NIP funding are to be <br />
 &nbsp;deployed in support of the preparation and implementation of EPAs <br />
 &nbsp;then either additional funds will be required or a major redeployment <br />

 Negotiating capacity<br />
 &nbsp;Concerns have been raised at the all-ACP level that it is too early <br />
 &nbsp;to begin the second phase of negotiations when so many issues remain <br />
 &nbsp;outstanding from Phase 1. Indeed, ACP representatives have expressed <br />
 &nbsp;concern at the lack of capacity in central Africa to engage meaningfully <br />
 &nbsp;in trade negotiations with the EU. There is concern that these 'negotiations' <br />
 &nbsp;will rather be a process by which these countries sign up to EU <br />
 &nbsp;proposals for EPAs, which then become the template for similar agreements <br />
 &nbsp;with other regions. These concerns account for the importance attached <br />
 &nbsp;by some ACP members to the follow-up mechanism designed to ensure <br /> &nbsp;coherence across the ACP.</p>
