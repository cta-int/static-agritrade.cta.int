			<h1>Commissioner Byrne reviews the impact of SPS on developing countries</h1>

			
			<h4>
												11 November 2004

					</header>


				<div class="intro">

						<p>&nbsp;The impact of EU SPS legislation on developing countries was the theme of an address to World Bank executive directors by the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, DavidByrne, on March 18 th 2004 .</p>

		</div>
		
		
					<p>&nbsp;As background to his remarks, Commissioner Byrne acknowledged the importance of agriculture to developing countries: 'food and food products continue to be disproportionately important in their trade figures', but 'SPS legislation is not an obstacle to trade. It is essential to trade'. This was why there was an SPS agreement in the Uruguay Round. Public confidence in food safety was critical to trade in food stuffs and therefore 'food safety cannot be manipulated to serve trade interests'.</p><p>&nbsp;According to Commissioner Byrne the EC plays a critical role in safeguarding the integrity of the system. He felt that the Commission had now got the balance right, with a new body of more powerful and up-to-date legislation in place, and denied that the EU used food-safety standards for protectionist purposes by recalling the fact that the EU is the single biggest importer of food in the world. The EU does not impose standards on others, but 'we do insist that conditions relating to imports should be no more favourable, or less favourable, than apply to domestic producers'. While 'the EU sets very high food-safety standards and ' these are difficult to meet, in particular for developing countries', they were necessary in order to ensure that EU health standards were not put at risk, since so much had been spent on eradicating diseases in Europe.</p><p>&nbsp;The EU was taking measures to facilitate imports by, for example, adopting a 'egionalisation approach', which accepted 'imports from regions of third countries where we are confident that this is not a risk to our public- or animal-health status'. The EU also supported risk assessments, for example with regard to BSE.</p><p>&nbsp;The EU has an open and transparent approach to food-safety issues, with vast amounts of data being placed on the internet: 'third countries can apply for authorisation following a clearly defined path. If they can satisfy the Commission that they meet our requirements, we take the necessary decisions to signal their compliance with our food-safety requirements'. The Commission was 'financing significant horizontal projects in the areas of fisheries, pesticides and animal health, targeted at the African Caribbean and Pacific countries in particular' and a multitude of SPS-related projects were being funded under individual national aid programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;Commissioner Byrne acknowledged that 'more should be done to assist developing countries meet our standards'. In this context he mentioned the new food-and-feed regulation which is expanding the scope for EU assistance in this area to include support for twinning and training projects between member states and developing countries. This is to be complemented by a major study on the potential impact of the new food-and-feed regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;In looking at the role that the World Bank could play around this issue Commissioner Byrne acknowledged that 'unless there is a serious effort to also strengthen the capacity of developing countries to meet the food-safety standards of the developed world, the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation in the food area may prove illusory'. LDCs have largely been unable to exploit the highly preferential access extended under the EBA initiative, and more support is needed to promote LDC- and developing-country participation in international fora rather than for assistance at the enterprise level or the level of public institutions responsible for verification and certification.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;The trade in food and food products is three times as important in value terms to ACP countries compared to the average for the EU’s trade with developing countries as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;With regard to the EU's 'regionalisation approach' it should be noted that after more than four years Namibia has still not been able to secure the application of such an approach to its bone-in lamb exports to the EU, despite the lamb-producing area being over 1,000 km from the cordoned off area where foot-and-mouth disease occurs. This suggest that the 'regionalisation approach' is being unevenly applied.</p><p>&nbsp;The Commission asserts that requests for authorisation to export to the EU follow a 'clearly defined path', but this can be an extremely long path. The problem is that there are no legally binding time-frames for the Commission to respond to SPS problems raised by developing countries. Given the limited staff available within the Commission working on these issues, for smaller ACP countries it tends to mean that their dossiers get pushed to the bottom of the pile in the face of SPS-related disputes with major developing-country trading partners such as China , Brazil or Argentina . In this context there is a need to establish legally binding time-frames within which SPS problems between developing countries and the EU should be resolved. This would provide greater certainty to investors in ACP countries who are developing new areas of exports to the EU.</p><p>&nbsp;While the Commission is financing specific horizontal programmes for ACP countries and the amounts deployed look significant, these programmes need to be seen against the background of the scale of the challenge faced, and the large number of ACP countries involved. When this broader background is considered it is clear that much more needs to be done and existing programmes constitute merely a start. The fact that this was acknowledged by Commissioner Byrne needs to be built on.</p><p>&nbsp;The Commissioner's observation that 'unless there is a serious effort to also strengthen the capacity of developing countries to meet the food-safety standards of the developed world, the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation in the food area may prove illusory', has profound implications for the conduct of EPA negotiations around SPS issues and adds a new dimension to the debate on 'additional funding'. The fact that the new food-and-feed regulation will not come into effect until 2006, raises the question: how will the Commission extend support to ACP countries in the interim?</p><p>&nbsp;Overall, despite the focus of the speech being on SPS legislation and developing countries, Commissioner Byrne demonstrated little awareness of the economic and institutional constraints on SPS compliance faced by ACP developing countries. He also glossed over the fact that extensive programmes of public aid are being put in place to assist EU enterprises in meeting the new food-safety standards. This lack of awareness and glossing over of the financial aspects does not bode well for ACP countries.</p>
