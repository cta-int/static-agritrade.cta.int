			<h1>The WTO negotiations and food security, price volatility and trade</h1>

			
			<h4>
												01 March 2011
										</h4>

					</header>


		
		
					<p>A paper on ‘Food security, price volatility and trade’ and their impact on developing countries has been posted by ICTSD. A major focus of the paper is on the impact of the WTO negotiations on the agricultural policy framework for the pursuit of food security objectives.</p><p>The paper notes that ‘there has been a steady shift in the locus of poverty in developing countries from rural to urban areas.’ This gives rise to a ‘policy dilemma between high food prices that benefit food producers (other things equal), and low food prices that may help poor consumers.’ It notes that a general assumption is made that from a developing country perspective, ‘the reduction or elimination of export and domestic subsidies and of barriers to market access is good for food security’. In this context, ‘a “good” policy outcome under the WTO would be the reduction or elimination of protection and subsidies in industrialized countries’. However it notes the counter argument that ‘usually the best policy option is not to maintain the distorting policies in industrialized countries but to eliminate them while at the same time implementing compensatory policies for the countries or populations affected.’</p><p>Against this background the paper reviews the progress made in the Doha Round negotiations around the 2008 Draft Modalities. The paper notes that:</p>
<ul>

<li>trade-distorting subsidies ‘would be cut further’, product-specific ‘amber box’ payments would be capped, while provisions dealing with ‘green box’ support would be tightened to ensure they are truly decoupled from production levies;</li>

<li>on market access, ‘tariffs would be cut according to a formula that imposes deeper cuts on higher tariffs’, the special safeguard provisions will be eliminated within 7 years, the liberalisation of market access for tropical products will be accelerated, while least developed countries would enjoy duty-free, quota-free access for up to 97% of their exports;</li>

<li>export subsidies would be eliminated over a 5-year period, while new disciplines will be introduced on export credits, export guarantees and insurance and international food aid, while the activities of state-owned enterprises would also be more closely regulated.</li>

</ul>
<p>However, the paper notes also that ‘the Draft Modalities still maintains important levels of distorting domestic support in industrialized countries and leaves open several possibilities that may compromise market access for developing countries (e.g. Sensitive Products)’.</p><p>The paper notes that while ‘protection for agriculture’ is often seen as the easiest option in developing countries, this ‘acts as a regressive and mostly privately collected tax on food: it has a larger negative incidence on poor consumers, who spend a greater percentage of their incomes on food, and is received mainly by bigger agricultural producers.’ It points out that ‘trade protection for any sector usually implies negative employment and production effects in other sectors, and can affect costs and competitiveness in sectors that have agricultural products as inputs.’</p><p>Against this background the paper argues that ‘research, extension, infrastructure, and irrigation, to name a few, are the real foundations for increases in production, productivity, and competitiveness’. It notes that from a developing-country policy perspective, the Draft Modalities:</p>
<ul>

<li>allow the maintenance of food security stocks and domestic food-aid programmes, although the financial constraints on developing countries in maintaining such programmes are highlighted;</li>

<li>provide considerable scope for ‘support to poor producers and production for food security’;</li>

<li>allow the speedy elimination of the special safeguard provisions and the creation of a new Special Safeguard Mechanism.</li>

</ul>
<p>The paper notes the growing policy concerns over price volatility, and argues that ‘measures taken by countries to try to reduce price volatility in their domestic markets, may exacerbate price volatility in world markets, by transferring outside the national markets the necessary price and quantity adjustments.’ It also identifies new proposals in the WTO to regulate policy measures which governments took in response to the 2007/08 price surge. These include proposals that:</p><p>a) ‘existing export prohibitions and restrictions in foodstuffs and feeds must be eliminated by the end of the first year of implementation of a potential Doha Round agreement’; and</p><p>b) new export prohibitions or restrictions cannot normally be longer than 12 months, and may exceed 18 months ‘only with the agreement of the affected importing Members.’</p><p>As part of its conclusions the analysis notes that since hunger and poverty largely occur at an individual and household level, special and differential treatment at the country level ‘may not focus on the main problem’ (i.e. ensuring individual and household food security). It further points out that protection which ‘may help some producers, adversely affects poor consumers’. It maintains that ‘the biggest constraints to effective agricultural and food security policies in developing countries result from financial, human and institutional capabilities.’ It argues that for the poorest countries to be able to expand investment in agriculture and rural development, ‘additional funding from international institutions and bilateral donors will be needed, as well as a firm commitment and good governance in the countries involved.’</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The ICTSD paper argues the Draft Modalities text allows developing countries considerable scope for promoting food security, but observes that many poor developing countries lack the financial means to make extensive use of these possibilities. It further notes the efforts under way to establish WTO disciplines on the use of export restrictions. In this context, the recent proposal from UK Environment Minister Caroline Spelman for a joint Anglo-French initiative to restrict the use of export bans and other forms of export restrictions is noteworthy.</p><p>This proposal highlights the intensifying debate on the use that should be allowed under trade agreements of various traditional trade-policy tools in support of national agricultural development and food security objectives. In the EU, a definite shift is taking place towards the greater use of financial support instruments and the introduction of measures to strengthen the functioning of agricultural supply chains, and towards the progressive dismantling of trade-policy tools. ACP countries are coming under pressure to make a similar transition. However this begs the question of where the funding will come from to address the ‘financial, human and institutional’ capacity constraints faced in ACP countries in order to make this transition. It also raises the question of how relevant the recent EU internal policy initiatives aimed at strengthening the functioning of agricultural supply chains are (see <i>Agritrade </i>article ‘
<a href="/en/layout/set/print/Thesaurus-labels/Agriculture/Commodities/Poultry" target="_blank">EC “milk package” proposals may hold lessons for other sectors</a>’, January 2011) to improving returns to ACP primary producers, thereby providing a financial incentive for further investment in improving productivity and yields.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the observation that ‘measures taken by countries to try to reduce price volatility in their domestic markets may exacerbate price volatility in world markets’ would appear to be as relevant to the elaboration of the EU’s evolving ‘safety-net’ policy as it is to the use of export bans and other forms of export restriction.</p>
