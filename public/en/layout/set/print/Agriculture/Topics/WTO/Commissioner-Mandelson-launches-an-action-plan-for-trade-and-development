			<h1>Commissioner Mandelson launches an action plan for trade and development</h1>

			
			<h4>
												28 February 2005
										</h4>

					</header>


				<div class="intro">

						<p> In a speech at the London School of Economics in early February 2005, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson put forward what he referred to as 'an action plan for progress' designed to make the 'multilateral trading system work at long last in the interests of the world's poor'.</p>

		</div>
		
		
					<p> The plan consists of:</p>
<ul>

<li>delivering development through market opening at the multilateral level; </li>

<li>maximising the use of special and differential treatment in the WTO; </li>

<li>promoting South-South market opening; </li>

<li>establishing pro-development rules and standards; </li>

<li>promoting greater convergence of food-safety standards, whilst paying attention to the cost implications for developing countries; </li>

<li>addressing preference erosion; </li>

<li>a generalised extension of the EBA by all OECD countries; </li>

<li>improvements to rules-of-origin provisions by harmonisation across all OECD markets; </li>

<li>introducing a strong development dimension into the EPA negotiations; </li>

<li>establishing mechanisms for monitoring the effectiveness of development assistance within the EPAs; </li>

<li>establishing internationally a special 'trade adjustment fund' which goes beyond existing IMF and World Bank efforts, with the EU 'going it alone' if an international consensus is not possible; </li>

<li>improved coordination of the aid and trade policies of the EC and individual member states; </li>

<li>greater transparency via the presentation of an annual white paper on the impact on development of trade preferences for EU imports from weak and vulnerable countries.</li>

</ul>
<p> This agenda would be promoted as appropriate via the Doha Development Round, coordinated action in the G-8, or unilateral EU action both within and outside of the context of the EPA negotiations.</p><p> One of the major components highlighted was 'delivering development through market opening' through the consolidation of CAP reform under the Doha Development Round, while requiring 'practically nothing' from G-90 countries in terms of market access 'apart from some binding of tariffs'. He emphasised the need for 'real flexibility' when it comes to liberalisation, and acknowledged that some countries 'should probably not be required to commit at all'. This formed part of a broader call for special treatment for vulnerable economies, such as the small-island states of the Caribbean. Progress had so far been held back by problems of definition, and in this context a small vulnerable economy should be 'a country with a very small share of world trade, with a small population, which is at an early stage of development (i.e. not Singapore) and whose people have low incomes, which is highly dependent on factors beyond its control such as climate and commodity dependence, and could be an island or land-locked in the middle of a continent'. However, Commissioner Mandelson while calling for 'special treatment for poor countries' expressed the view that there should be no 'blanket exemptions and permanent carve-outs'. There should be a 'breathing space for countries on a case-by-case basis until they are in a position to comply', so-called 'differential flexibility, not permanent opting-out'.</p><p> More thought needed to be given to the issue of preference erosion, but with only a limited number of sectors being affected, he expressed the view that this could probably be addressed 'through enhanced trading opportunities and through readjustment assistance'.</p><p> In terms of putting development at the centre of the EPA process Commissioner Mandelson once more highlighted that 'the purpose of EPAs is to promote regional integration and economic development', with trade barriers against EU goods only coming down 'when liberalisation is in the interest of our EPA partners themselves as part of their development agenda'. The key question was 'what progress the EPA countries are making in their capacity to trade, including with each other, and how we in Europe can help advance this'.</p><p>
 Commenting on the plan of action, David Jessop, the director of the Caribbean Council argued that Commissioner Mandelson would have to work hard to energise the Brussels bureaucracy if he is to create 'the development mechanisms necessary to drive an economic revolution in the developing world'.<br /> </p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p> Commissioner Mandelson recognises the need to convince developing countries that they actually have something to gain from the Doha Development Round. This is a major challenge in the case of the ACP. CAP reform, bilateral liberalisation and multilateral liberalisation are all eroding the margins of preference which ACP countries have traditionally enjoyed. While LDC member could potentially benefit from a generalised application of EBA and simpler harmonised rules of origin, these benefits will not be realised unless existing supply-side constraints are addressed. Equally, as the former Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne, noted 'unless there is a serious effort to &quot;strengthen the capacity of developing countries to meet the food-safety standards of the developed world, the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation in the food area may prove illusory'. With food and agricultural products accounting for 31.4% of ACP exports to the EU in 2003 (47.5% if petroleum and diamonds are excluded), operationalising EU rhetorical commitments on increased support to ACP countries in meeting EU food-safety standards is now an urgent priority.</p><p> Turning to the contention that the Doha Development Round requires 'practically nothing' from G-90 countries (including all ACP countries), this needs to be seen against the background of the ongoing EPA negotiations in which the EC is likely to seek commitments on liberalisation of trade in goods and services and in trade-related areas which go substantially beyond what G-90 countries would be asked for in the WTO context. Furthermore, the August WTO agreement secured virtually all of the EU's objectives in the agricultural sector, including international acceptance of the current trajectory of CAP reform. This is stimulating major new investments, particularly in new member states, and a significant increase in production in all major sectors except beef and dairy production. This raises serious doubts concerning the 'non-trade-distorting' nature of the reformed CAP's agricultural support instruments.</p><p> For ACP countries the process of preference erosion affects more products than was initially assumed. The EC has shown great awareness of the impact of sugar-sector reform on ACP earnings, with income losses based on current Commission proposals of around Euro 250 million per annum. The EC has been less sensitive to the income losses in the beef sector, where southern African exporters saw nearly a 30% decline in prices received on the UK market, largely as a result of the shift over to direct aid payments in the beef sector. This applies equally in the rice sector where EU prices halved in 2004, with direct consequences for Caribbean rice suppliers. The Commission has also to date paid little attention to the implications of the incorporation of the fruit-and-vegetable sector into the single farm payment scheme, a move which is likely to see EU market prices fall significantly. It should be borne in mind that meat products, vegetables, fruits and sugar, accounted for 34% of ACP agricultural exports to the EU-15 in 2003 (Euro 3,211 million).</p><p> The importance of regional integration to getting to grips with the development challenges faced (particularly in Africa) is widely recognised. However the need for development integration as opposed to simply trade integration is widely overlooked. This was recently highlighted by a presentation to the economic committee of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly by the Chair of the South African Parliament's Finance Committee, Rob Davies, MP. He pointed out that in southern Africa, despite South Africa extensively opening up its market to regional exporters on an asymmetric basis, the region's trade imbalance with South Africa continued to grow, because the underlying constraints on production which are central to development integration have been largely unaddressed. This raises important questions about the nature of the regional-integration process that the EU is committed to supporting amongst ACP countries and its sequencing with the negotiation and implementation of EPAs. In short, can regional development integration be firmly and sustainably established in Africa prior to the introduction of reciprocity in trade relations with the EU, within the current time-frames envisaged by the E &quot;Che need to ease the arbitrary WTO time constraint (the 2008 deadline for conclusion of EPAs) is increasingly becoming a focus of discussions amongst ACP negotiators in Brussels.</p>
