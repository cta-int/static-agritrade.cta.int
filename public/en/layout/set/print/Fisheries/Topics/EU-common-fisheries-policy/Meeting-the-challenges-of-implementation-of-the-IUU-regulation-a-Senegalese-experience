			<h1>Meeting the challenges of implementation of the IUU regulation: a Senegalese experience</h1>

					<p><i>Interview with Mr Gaoussou Gueye, a Senegalese fish trader and exporter, Vice-President of the National Senegalese Artisanal Fishing Inter- professional Council (CONIPAS)</i></p><p><b><i>Q: Today, almost six months after the coming into force of the European regulation to combat IUU (illegal, unreported, unregulated) fishing, have you experienced any particular problems?</i></b></p><p>During January, a problem arose for Senegalese fishing professionals due to delays in the processing of the catch certificates by the Spanish authorities. Some fish consignments were blocked in Madrid for several days and, consequently, sanitary alerts were issued for the fresh fish products concerned. People need to realise that high-quality fresh fish products are extremely perishable and a hold up of several days degrades their quality irreversibly. Another practical problem was the official language in which the certificate had to be filled in: the Senegalese competent authority issued catch certificates in French but the Spanish authorities requested certificates in Spanish. Fortunately, we had set up a ‘watch dog’ committee, in which both the Senegalese administration and the sector participate, and which can react quickly when this type of administrative problem arises. On these particular problems, thanks to direct contact with the people concerned from the Spanish administration, we were reassured that these were early-day difficulties which should not be repeated in the future… But for us, the main challenges arose in the two months preceding the IUU regulation implementation, as we tried to be ready in time. </p><p><b><i>Q: Why did you wait for the last months to prepare? The European Commission has been organising awareness-raising and information activities for the exporting countries since 2008 …</i></b> </p><p>We had the details of the IUU regulation in our hands in November 2009. My colleagues from Mauritania found themselves in the same boat, as they also discovered rather late in the day how their products were going to be treated. It is very a good thing that the European Union undertook these awareness-raising and information actions, but often, information does not reach the private sector in its entirety, especially small companies, even if as in both Senegal and Mauritania, they represent an important part of the fisheries-export sector. Nowadays, in the region, artisanal fishing is organised at the national and regional levels, through a confederation. It is now easy to identify the artisanal sector interlocutors. </p><p><b><i>Q: What were the key problems you faced in preparing for the implementation of the regulation?</i></b> </p><p>I would really like to emphasise that the initiative was taken by the fisheries sector itself to raise awareness with the administration, through meetings organised in December 2009 on the importance of this new regulation and the deadlines to be respected. This, for me, once more shows the need for having a constant dialogue between the fisheries sector as a whole and the administrations concerned; in many cases, exporters of fishery products are watching international developments every day, and can raise the alarm when a quick response to a situation is essential. It is our livelihood; we cannot let things drop like that. </p><p><b><i>Q: In practice, how was this dialogue set up between the authorities and the sector for the implementation of the regulation?</i></b> </p><p>In Senegal, it was a wise choice to designate the administration in charge of the Fisheries Monitoring and Surveillance (DPSP) as the competent authority, but this nevertheless posed some practical problems. Beforehand, this administration had few contacts with the fish-exporting sector. It works in a decentralised way, with antennae on the coast, whereas the fish exports, supervised by the Directorate for Industry, are centralised at the port and the airport. It was thus necessary to organise collaboration between these various administrative services, and the choice was made to gather them into a single administrative antenna at the airport, which now assembles all the competent services for fish exports. This helps people from the fisheries sector avoid having to run from one office to another to validate the catch certificates. </p><p><b><i>Q: All that requires financial means….</i></b> </p><p>Of course. Investments to make this administrative antenna work were necessary: purchasing computers, leasing an office, etc. Unfortunately, these expenses were not budgeted for by the public authorities. Investments by the private sector were therefore essential to allow a smooth implementation of the regulation. But there still remain important expenses to cover, in particular as regards personnel: currently, people from the administration work overtime to ensure a service 24/24 in this administrative antenna. There are still material needs as well - computers, printers, etc to make this antenna fully functional. Another important challenge was the installation of the administrative procedure leading to the IUU regulation catch certificate. </p><p><b><i>Q: Did you have to start from scratch to work out this procedure?</i></b> </p><p>No, fortunately not. In the case of Senegal two instruments already existed, including at the level of artisanal fishing: a system of registration for the pirogues and a system of first-sale certificates. </p><p><b><i>Q: All the pirogues that catch for the export trade were already registered?</i></b> </p><p>They were not, but the registration system for the pirogues had already been launched, and the administration had a list of the pirogues already registered. In this regard one could even say that the implementation of the IUU regulation had a positive effect on the Senegalese fishermen. In my locality, M’Bour, one of the most important fishing sites in Senegal, the day before the coming into force of the IUU regulation, 280 fishermen registered their pirogues, because they had seen how important this was in allowing the sale of their products. That underlines the significant efforts done by the sector organisations, in the last weeks before the implementation of the IUU regulation, to raise awareness with their members. Because even if we had a system of traceability, it needed to be more rigorous and coherent in terms of the information contained in the first-sale certificates, in order to ensure greater reliability and usability of the basic information collected from these fishermen. </p><p><b><i>Q: Can you detail for us what information can now be found on a first-sale certificate? </i></b></p><p>The certificate contains the pirogue serial number, the fishing permit number, the weight of the catches, the fishing area, as well as the details concerning the transport used to bring fish to the airport, which must be accredited. There are 174 landing quays in Senegal, but only 8 are accredited to issue first-sale certificates. These are the quays where the Maritime Fisheries Directorate (DPM) is present. I must stress that the delivery of the catch certificates constitutes an additional workload assigned to DPM agents who previously had other tasks to assume. These people today work exclusively to control and validate the certificates. It remains to be seen whether the other tasks carried out before will suffer or not from this additional workload related to the catch certificates. In the same way, there will soon be a problem of space for catch certificates’ data storage. This had not been sufficiently taken into account, at the beginning, when the competent authority services were installed. </p><p><b><i>Q: In practice, how does the system function to obtain the catch certificate making it possible to export to the EU?</i></b></p><p>In practice, for the artisanal fishing sector, the first-sale certificate, obtained at the level of the landing site, is issued by the Maritime Fisheries Directorate (DPM). It then goes to the Fisheries Monitoring and Surveillance Directorate (DPSP), the competent authority issuing the catch certificate. Then, the Fish-Processing Industries Directorate (DITP), which is the competent authority for sanitary approval, issues the health certificate. It should be noted that without a catch certificate, no health certificate can be delivered. As you can see, all that can take much time. The fact that we have today an antenna which gathers representatives of these various administrative services has helped to limit these delays, but it would be necessary, for example, to computerise the first-sale certificates, in order to allow fast transmission of these to the competent authorities. We need a fast efficient system for certification, to avoid, as much as possible, delays which affect the quality of the product. It is essential that the EU, committed as it is to supporting third countries in implementing this regulation, helps us in these fields. </p><p><b><i>Q: Overall, did this regulation have negative or positive impacts?</i></b></p><p>I don’t know whether this regulation has had any positive effects in stopping illegal fishing in our waters or to slow down the trade in illegally caught fish products. I suppose at some point it will be necessary to evaluate that, and to see whether the costs of the regulation are proportionate to the benefits. In any case, for Senegal, the installation of this legislation mobilised the fisheries sector and the administrations concerned, which allowed a general improvement of traceability. We also welcomed the flexibility which was introduced into the regulation for artisanal fishing. Without that, it would have been very difficult for us to be able to continue to export. </p><p>But much progress is still needed, and a targeted help from the EU would be more than necessary, especially as regards recruiting and training new staff, computerising the certificates, and not forgetting to support our countries in improving control at sea, in order to combat those vessels operating illegally in our waters.</p>
