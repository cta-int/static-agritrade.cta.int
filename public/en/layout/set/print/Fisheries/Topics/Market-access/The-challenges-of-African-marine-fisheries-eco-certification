						<p>Dr André Standing is an independent researcher based in Kenya, specialising on the governance of natural resources. In 2009, he undertook a review of certification of marine fisheries in Southern and Eastern Africa for the Institute for Security Studies, a leading Africa-based think-tank. Dr Standing’s research and writing on fisheries continues to examine the politics of fisheries management, with a particular focus on corruption, accountability and access to information.</p>

					<a name="eztoc185151_0_0_0_1" id="eztoc185151_0_0_0_1"></a><h5>An interview with Dr Andre Standing, Kenya</h5><p><b>Q: There is currently a debate on the credibility of the certification of marine fisheries, focusing on the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), which represents the world leading certification body. How is this relevant to African fisheries?</b></p><p>The growth of eco-labelling in Africa remains ‘work in progress’. The South African deep-sea hake trawl industry is still the only marine fishery to have obtained MSC certification. However, a significant number of other fisheries have begun the certification process or have shown strong interest in doing so. They include the hake fishery in Namibia, an association of tuna fishing boats in South Africa, rock-lobster fisheries in both Kenya and off the Tristan da Cunha islands, prawn fisheries in both Mozambique and Madagascar and an octopus fishery in Tanzania.</p><p>Ever since the MSC started, independent studies have raised objections, with experts arguing the MSC has labelled several unsustainable fisheries. It appears that one of the main causes of this controversy is the inherent risk of conflicts of interests in the MSC assessment process. There are commercial incentives for certifying bodies working for the MSC to give favourable assessments to clients, and the MSC has a vested interest in growing the initiative.</p><p>To some extent, biased and inappropriate findings of certifying bodies is countered by a peer-review mechanism, and the MSC has developed and improved mechanisms and procedures that enable others to contest the decisions taken. MSC is in fact far more responsible in this way than other rival certification initiatives. But there are still flaws in the way peer reviews are conducted by the MSC. Civil society may not have the capacity to influence the decisions of certifying bodies and provide the necessary checks and balances.</p><p>A further problem of the MSC is that it has certified unsustainable fisheries, on the grounds that changes will be made to the fishery in the future. Consumers are unlikely to be aware of this situation. In some cases improvements are not made, yet fisheries keep trading their products with the MSC label. The MSC therefore promotes several fisheries that may not meet very high environmental standards.</p><p>Maintaining the credibility of the certification process, which includes strengthening civil society oversight, therefore remains an ongoing and difficult challenge. There are structural problems in the way that the MSC is set up, which means this challenge may not be overcome. Providing consumers with reliable information about how fish is caught and what impact this is having on the environment remains a sound idea, but this needs to be done in a way that is separate from commercial interests. Ultimately eco-labelling, as it exists now, may be a weak solution to overfishing and may actually work as a barrier to more profound policy changes.</p><p><b>Q: Another issue often mentioned is the fact that the costs of certification would be too high for developing world fisheries. What do you think?</b></p><p>The actual costs of certification tend to be misunderstood. The fees paid for pre-assessment and assessment for certification are only one aspect. In order for a fishery to achieve certification, it is normal that several conditions are set by the certifying organisation. These can include changes to the methods and equipment used in the fishery, for example. The costs of meeting these conditions, in many cases, tend to be much higher than the fees paid for assessment and pre-assessment.</p><p>Altogether, the costs of gaining accreditation to undertake assessments are expensive and few African companies may be able to afford this. And the benefits, in terms of improved market access and a price premium for certified fish products, are not always evident as the benefits of certification are unknown in advance. It is difficult for fishing companies to know if it is commercially viable. It’s therefore important than those industries considering certification conduct careful analysis regarding the financial implications of adapting fisheries to achieve and maintain certification. Such analysis tends to be very difficult to undertake, and it is even confusing to know the costs and benefits for those industries that have had the MSC logo for some time. Of course, many donors and philanthropic organisations have provided funding to help fisheries afford certification. There are probably many opportunities for this support in Africa. However, we have to wonder whether a voluntary market mechanism is sustainable if it relies on such subsidisation.</p><p><b>Q: What about the benefits of certification?</b></p><p>Potential benefits for fishing companies include improved market access, the strengthening of their environmental legitimacy, the potential for gaining a price premium and the opportunity to influence the management of their fishery.</p><p>However, evidence for the benefits of certification remains highly contested, with some observers arguing that third-party certification schemes offer commercial benefits for fishing companies but little prospect for addressing over-fishing and the loss of marine ecosystems.</p><p>These recent critics suggest that the standards of sustainability need to be more ambitious if environmental benefits are to be improved on. However, raising standards too high will reduce the number of fisheries that will voluntarily engage in these schemes. Tension exists between maximising the environmental impact of certification and growing its market coverage.</p><p>Where there are commercial benefits, we need to consider how these benefits are shared throughout the supply chain. In many cases it seems that the principle benefactors are the owners of exports companies selling into foreign markets, not necessarily workers and fishers. In other words, if the MSC leads to increased prices, the resulting growth in profits may not trickle down very far.</p><p>Another aspect to consider is the risk of de-certification. Having invested in gaining certification, there are a number of external factors that may negatively impact on the fishery, resulting in the fishery being de-certified. These external factors can include changes in fisheries management by government departments, impact of climate change, illegal fishing etc. Losing certification can be highly negative for marketing as it sends out confusing messages to consumers and retailers – some suggest that, for some fisheries, the risks of de-certification outweigh the benefits of gaining certification.</p><p><b>Q: What is the role of the states in voluntary certification schemes?</b></p><p>Although certification initiatives are presented as voluntary market mechanisms to promote sustainable fisheries, states play a critical role in the success of certification schemes. This includes providing statistical data for the assessment process and potentially making changes to fisheries management - such as implementing catch restrictions and rules on fishing gear. Indeed, one of the three main considerations under the MSC certification process is the strength of management, with the other two being sustainability of fish populations and the wider ecosystem impact.</p><p>A positive aspect of the interaction between fishing industries and government agencies in obtaining and maintaining eco-labels is that it can improve collaboration between private companies or fishing associations and state departments.</p><p>However, in some cases, African governmental agencies responsible for fisheries management may lack the capacity, expertise and political will to respond to these requests. In several countries fisheries management also lacks transparency and accountability, while problems of corruption are commonplace. Data on financial flows and the number of licenses sold to fishing companies are often not made public. Where official data is published, it sometimes lacks reliability. For instance, official statistics on the volume of export of octopus from Tanzania are less than 50% of what the industry and other independent sources records. The situation could pose challenges to certifying bodies and prove frustrating to industry clients.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Q: Can voluntary certification schemes function as a barrier to international trade?</b></p><p>It is not the intention of eco-labels to exclude fisheries or function as barriers to trade for fisheries that are sustainable. However, in theory voluntary certification schemes may have the unintended consequence of excluding uncertified fisheries from international markets. What makes this problematic is that many fisheries that may meet the MSC criteria cannot afford certification or they chose to opt out for other reasons. This is of particular concern to fisheries in developing countries, which are responsible for about half of the world trade in fish products.</p><p>However, for the time being it is difficult to find clear examples in the developing world where fishing companies are denied access to markets because they don’t have a credible eco-label. Demand for eco-labelled fish is thought to be high in Western countries, particularly among the member states of the EU, but there remains an insatiable market for good quality fish products – eco-labelled or not. I am not aware of uncertified fish products losing out to certified ones. Yet here lies an important contradiction for global eco-labelling initiatives. Their success depends on being able to promote the good fisheries at the expense of the bad ones. Yet if they grow to a point where they operate as informal barriers to trade, they will come under fierce criticism, particularly if it is shown that gaining certification is partly dependant on access to capital. It is unlikely that international fisheries will allow a UK-based non-profit organisation to become that influential in controlling access to global markets.</p><p><b>Q: A concern often put forward is that certification tends to favour industrial fisheries and does not promote the interests of the small-scale fishing sector. Do you share this concern?</b></p><p>Yes. The system of certification does appear biased in favour of larger industrial fisheries. South Africa’s hake-trawl fishery, one of the fisheries that have been certified in developing countries, is an industrialised fishery, led by large multinational companies. Several of the other developing-country fisheries that are expected to enter into the MSC certification process in Africa are similarly industrialised and many are foreign owned. For example, most of the companies operating in Mozambique’s prawn sector are joint ventures between Mozambique business and political elites and Spanish, South African, Russian and Japanese companies.</p><p>There are several reasons why eco-certification of small-scale fisheries is difficult, despite their characteristics, which, some people argue, are more in line with sustainable fisheries. First of all, certification schemes are expensive. Few small-scale fisheries have capital to hand for up-front payments for the process. Management of the small-scale fisheries sector in developing countries also tends to be poor. Data on artisanal fisheries are often lacking or incomplete. A recent study has shown that official data on fish landings, as presented by the FAO for Mozambique and Tanzania, significantly under-record catches from artisanal fisheries. By reconstructing historical catch data this study claimed official reported catches in Mozambique underestimate actual catches by a factor of 6.2 in Mozambique and 1.7 in Tanzania.</p><p>Finally, it may be difficult for initiatives such as the MSC to identify an appropriate unit of certification for small-scale fisheries. Many artisanal fisheries are involved in a mixed fishery, using multi-gear fishing techniques. Certifying a mixed fishery appears to be far more complex than certifying a single-species fishery.</p><p>That’s probably why, at the FAO summit on small-scale fisheries, small-scale fisheries representatives rejected certification initiatives based on the argument that these negatively impact on the development of coastal communities, a view that many of the world’s leading experts on fisheries endorse.</p><p>Steps are being taken by the MSC to try and address these concerns, by developing new methods for evaluating the sustainability of ‘data-deficient’ fisheries, including small-scale fishing sectors.</p><p>Unfortunately, as financial support is increasingly made available for small-scale fisheries in gaining certification, what we are seeing now is that the certification of small-scale fisheries has taken on the characteristics of a traditional donor-style activity and it is far removed from being a voluntary market mechanism as originally conceived.</p><p>In fact, it appears that the attempt to certify small-scale fisheries in Africa is partly driven by the desire to improve the legitimacy of certifying organisations.</p><p><b>Q: Do certification schemes need to do more in considering their social and economic impact on local fisheries?</b></p><p>The MSC argues that the purpose of eco-labels is to inform consumers about the environmental impact of fisheries, and not to deal with social and economic criteria, a role that is met by companies such as Fair Trade. The impact of certification on human development, poverty alleviation, etc (MDG) requires further debate. Like in other developing countries, African fisheries are an essential industry, not only in terms of exports and job creation, but also in terms of promoting food security and livelihoods. Sustainable fishing in Africa must incorporate human development if it is to succeed. Perhaps this is the key challenge for the growth of certification in Africa? If it fails to have a developmental dividend, then it is unlikely to succeed.</p>
