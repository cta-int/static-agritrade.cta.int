			<h1>The July 31st 2004 WTO Agreement on Agriculture: a critical review</h1>

			
			<h4>
												26 September 2004
										</h4>

					</header>


				<div class="intro">

						<p>
 <b>What does the July 31st WTO agricultural agreement cover?</b> <br/>
 The agreement on the framework for establishing modalities in WTO agriculture negotiations consists of eight sections:<br/> </p>
<ul>

<li> an introduction (paragraphs 1-5); </li>

<li> domestic agricultural support (paragraphs 6-16); </li>

<li> export competition (paragraphs 17-26); </li>

<li> market-access commitments (paragraphs 27-44); </li>

<li> treatment of LDCs (paragraphs 45-46); </li>

<li> treatment of recently acceded members (paragraphs 47); </li>

<li> monitoring and surveillance of the agreement (paragraphs 48); </li>

<li> other issues (paragraphs 49-50).</li>

</ul>
<p> Of these, the first five are of greatest interest to the ACP.</p>

		</div>
		
		
					<p><b>What does the agreement say?</b> </p><p>
<b>The introduction</b> <br/>
 The introduction sets out the basis of the agreement and the objectives of the modalities agreement. It emphasises the importance of attaining a balanced agreement and &quot;operationally effective and meaningful provisions for special and differential treatment for developing-country members?. It stresses that members should be allowed to pursue policies which are &quot;supportive of their development goals, poverty-reduction strategies, food security and livelihood concern &quot;snd sets out the main pillars of an agreement: domestic support, export competition and market access. <br/> </p><p> Of specific interest to West and Central African ACP countries, it commits the WTO to appropriate prioritisation of the cotton issue. It creates a subcommittee on cotton to advise on progress on the issue. This marks a change from the draft text which called for cotton issues to be addressed &quot;as an integral part of the agricultural negotiations?. The final text is more procedural and less specific than the draft text, with references to &quot;substantial and effective reductions in Member &quot;sroduct-specific support?, &quot;substantial improvements in market acces &quot;snd &quot;the elimination of export subsidies and elimination of trade-distorting elements of other export competition instrument &quot;sll being removed from the final text.</p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>The text on cotton makes no reference to the specific demands made by West and Central African cotton producers as supported by the ACP Group. This, presumably, will be left to the special subcommittee to deal with, and make recommendations to the Committee on Agriculture. It remains to be seen whether this will result in more focussed attention being paid to the cotton issue, or its marginalisation.</i> <br/> </p><p>
<b>On domestic support</b> <br/>
 On domestic support, the text begins with a reiteration of the Doha Ministerial declaration?s call for &quot;substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support?. The text approaches this objective via: <br/> </p>
<ul>

<li> a re-assertion of the need for special and differential treatment; </li>

<li> a commitment to harmonisation with higher levels of support being subject to larger cuts; </li>

<li> a commitment to &quot;a substantial reduction in the overall level of trade-distorting support?; </li>

<li> a commitment to a substantial reduction in final bound aggregate levels of support. </li>

</ul>
<p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>For the EU, the commitment to substantial reductions in bound levels of trade-distorting support need not mean a substantial reduction in actual levels of trade-distorting support, since the bound levels of support are already substantially higher than the actual levels of support. The reductions in trade-distorting domestic support is to be based on a tiered formula with the &quot;sum of all trade-distorting suppor &quot;tot exceeding 80% of the sum of the Final Bound Total &quot;Aggregate Measure of Support? (AMS) plus permitted de minimis, plus the Blue Box?, at a level no more than €5% of a Member’s average total value of agricultural production during an historical period?. These reductions represent the minimum reductions to be made. Product-specific aggregate measures of support are also to be capped. It has been agreed that &quot;Substantial reductions in Final Bound Total AMS will result in reductions of some product-specific support?.</i> <br/> </p><p> With regard to disciplines on de minimis support in the final text there are stronger exceptions to the rules for developing countries although the basis for cutting de minimis support is still to be agreed.</p><p> The final July 31st agreement reiterates the sentiments in the draft in recognising &quot;the role of the Blue Box in promoting agricultural reforms &quot;and in this context will continue to allow:</p><p> ?Direct payments under production-limiting programmes if:</p>
<ul>

<li> such payments are based on fixed and unchanging areas and yields; or </li>

<li> such payments are made on 85% or less of a fixed and unchanging base level of production; or </li>

<li> livestock payments are made on a fixed and unchanging number of head. </li>

</ul>
<p> Or direct payments that do not require production limitation if:</p>
<ul>

<li> such payments are based on fixed and unchanging bases and yields; or </li>

<li> livestock payments made on a fixed and unchanging number of head; and </li>

<li> such payments are made on 85% or less of a fixed and unchanging base level of production.? </li>

</ul>
<p> These criteria are designed to ensure that &quot;Blue Box payments are less trade-distorting than AMS measures?. In this context, in disciplining &quot;blue bo &quot;xupport the agreement states that any criteria for disciplining blue box support &quot;will not have the perverse effect of undoing ongoing reforms?. This, alongside the provision that states &quot;where a Member has placed an exceptionally large percentage of its trade-distorting support in the Blue Box, some flexibility will be provided on a basis to be agreed to ensure that such a Member is not called upon to make a wholly disproportionate cut?, accords considerable protection to those countries heavily dependent on &quot;blue bo &quot;xorms of support.</p><p> On the &quot;green bo &quot;xhe agreement stipulates that &quot;Green Box criteria will be reviewed and clarified with a view to ensuring that Green Box measures have no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on production?.</p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>The provision that any criteria for disciplining blue box support &quot;will not have the perverse effect of undoing ongoing reforms?, is a critical provision for the EU, for it protects the current trajectory for CAP reform from any challenge in the WTO. This has always been a critical objective of the EU, since the whole basis of CAP reform is to shift agricultural support into &quot;blue bo &quot;xnd &quot;green bo &quot;xeasures, which are then protected from challenge from within the WTO. The EU then allows the discussion to focus on reducing trade-distorting forms of support on which the EU is less and less reliant, as a result of the consolidation and extension of the trajectory for CAP reform.</i> <br/> </p><p>
<b>On export competition</b> <br/>
 On export competition, the agreement commits members to establishing detailed modalities to ensure &quot;the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect by a credible end date.? This includes commitments on export subsidies, export credits, export credit guarantees or insurance programmes (longer than 180 days); the trade-distorting practices of state-trading enterprises and abuses of food aid arrangements which displace commercial transactions. Provision is made for the waiving of disciplines on food aid operations in exceptional circumstances. <br/> </p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>Significantly, from an EU perspective, the agreement includes provisions stipulating that the phasing-in of these commitments will &quot;take into account the need for some coherence with internal reform steps of members?. This effectively subordinates the implementation of commitments on export refunds to the successful attainment of domestic-reform programmes which effectively do away with the need for such export support. This demonstrates the primacy which domestic-reform measures in major OECD countries take over international obligations.</i> <br/> </p><p> The agreement makes provision for special and differential treatment for developing countries on reductions of export support, including special provisions for state-trading enterprises where their operations have food-security dimensions and longer implementation periods for the phasing-out of export support linked to the progress made in removing export support in developed countries.</p><p>
<b>On market access</b> <br/>
 With regard to market access, a tiered formula approach has been agreed. Tariff reductions are to be made from bound levels and lead to a substantial overall reduction; each WTO member is required to make a contribution, although within the principle of special and differential treatment. There are to be larger cuts for higher tariffs than for lower tariffs; although this will allow provision to be made for sensitive products, improved market access should be achieved across all products. Significantly &quot;the number of bands, the thresholds for defining the bands and the type of tariff reduction in each band remain under negotiation?. Thus the major component of the market-access formula still needs to be agreed. <br/> </p><p> In terms of dealing with &quot;special product &quot;srovision is made for the designation of &quot;an appropriate numbe &quot;rf special products, with this appropriate level still to be negotiated. This is less specific than the proposal in the draft which spoke of selection being based on &quot;tariff lines which currently incorporate out-of-quota tariff rates?. For sensitive products &quot;substantial improvemen &quot;tan include &quot;combinations of tariff-quota commitments and tariff reductions applying to each product?. It commits to both in-quota tariff-rate cuts and improving the administration of quotas. Significantly references in the draft to &quot;a minimum cut in the out-of-quota tariff rate will be establishe &quot;dave been deleted from the final text.</p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>The greater use of tariff-rate quotas to provide significant improvemen &quot;tn access is in line with EC suggestions. This allows the EU to use tariff-rate quotas negotiated under bilateral trade agreements as &quot;part paymen &quot;tn meeting WTO obligations on substantial market opening in all sectors.</i> <br/> </p><p> Some six paragraphs of the text on market access deal with special and differential treatment on market-access commitments. The first commits to SDT for developing countries on the tariff-reduction commitments required. The second paragraph requires &quot;lesser tariff-reduction commitments from developing-country Members?. The third paragraph allows developing countries to designate an &quot;appropriate number of products as Special Products, based on criteria of food security, livelihood security and rural development needs.? Such products will then be eligible for &quot;flexible treatment?. The fourth paragraph allows for special safeguard mechanisms for developing countries. The fifth paragraph deals with moving towards &quot;the fullest liberalisation of trade in tropical agricultural products?. The final paragraph recognises the &quot;importance of long-standing preferences?.</p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>The provision recognising the &quot;importance of long-standing preference &quot;ss of vital interest to the ACP who potentially have the most to lose from the multilateral process of tariff reduction given the traditionally high margins of preference which they have enjoyed on the EU market. However the agreement gives no indication as to how the recognition of the &quot;importance of long-standing preference &quot;ss to be given practical expression.</i> <br/> </p><p>
<b>On least developed countries </b> <br/>
 On LDCs, the final text contains a strengthened commitment from developed and advanced developing countries to extend full duty- and quota-free access to exports from LDCs and a reiteration of the importance of the cotton issue. In addition LDCs will not be called upon to make additional commitments in a WTO context with regard to tariff reductions and reductions in levels of domestic support. <br/> </p><p><i>Comment</i> </p><p>
<i>The provisions on LDCs effectively incorporates into the agreement the longstanding EU call for OECD and advanced developing countries to extend EBA-type preferences to LDCs.</i> <br/> </p><p><i>It should be noted while LDCs are not to be required to undertake further tariff reduction commitments in a WTO framework, the EU continues to encourage LDC ACP countries to make extensive tariff-elimination commitments in the context of the on-going EPA negotiations. This appears to represent an inconsistency in the EU’s position on the market-access commitments of LDCs.</i> </p><p><b>Implications for ACP countries</b> </p><p>
<b>On domestic support</b> <br/>
 Effectively the provisions on domestic support, by securing within a WTO framework acceptance of the current trajectory for EU CAP reform, leaves un-addressed the new forms of trade distortion arising from new patterns of EU agricultural support. This will give added significance to the provisions of any future EPAs on safeguard arrangements, since it will only be through such mechanisms that ACP countries will be able to defend themselves against competition from increasingly price competitive EU food-product exports. EC claims to the contrary notwithstanding, this enhanced price-competitive position is based largely on the shift in the basis for agricultural sector support in the EU (from price support to direct aid to farmers.<br/> </p><p>
<b>On export competition</b> <br/>
 While the commitment to the phasing-out &quot;in paralle &quot;lf all forms of direct public aid to export competitiveness is to be welcomed, the benefits which ACP countries will gain from this will be undermined by the sequencing of these obligations on the progress of internal processes of reform in the exporting country. Effectively in an EU context, export subsidies will only be phased out when domestic reforms have de facto done away with the need for such assistance. This, however, will not mean the end of EU public assistance to exports, simply that EU public aid will now be indirectly supporting exports through defraying certain production costs via the provision of direct aid payments to EU farmers.<br/> </p><p>
<b>On market access</b> <br/>
 The EC proposal that the G90 should get the &quot;round for fre &quot;eas not been fully incorporated into the final text; provision is simply made for SDT for developing countries on the tariff-reduction commitments required.<br/> </p><p> While the text acknowledges the &quot;importance of long-standing preference &quot;she reality for ACP countries (particularly LDCs) is that any substantial EU tariff reductions in a multilateral context will simply erode the margins of preference which ACP suppliers enjoy. It is far from clear how in their trade relationship with the EU, the ACP are to be &quot;compensate &quot;dor this process of preference erosion. *</p><p> It has long been the EU position that for LDC ACP countries any &quot;compensatio &quot;nt the WTO level will largely take the form of improved access to other OECD and advanced developing country markets, through WTO commitments placed on these countries to extend EBA-type preferences to all LDCs. This position is now entrenched in the July 31st agreement.</p><p>
<b>How the EU sees the agreement on agriculture</b> <br/>
 ?The framework locks in the recent reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). They will not be called into question. The agreement also ensures that other developed countries, in particular the USA , will have to undertake reforms. This will be achieved by a combination of disciplines on the different forms of support.<br/> </p>
<ul>

<li> Overall levels of the most trade-distorting domestic support will have to be substantially reduced. </li>

<li> A down-payment of 20% of this reduction will be made in year 1 of the implementation period. This is a bigger cut than the reductions made following the Uruguay Round over six years. </li>

<li> Big subsidisers will make the deepest cuts. </li>

<li> Blue box support cannot exceed 5% of agricultural production, no further reduction is foreseen. </li>

<li> The non-trade-distorting green box remains untouched. </li>

<li> The de <i>minimis</i>-loophole will be reduced. </li>

</ul>
<p> On export competition, the EU’s objective was to ensure equal treatment for all forms of trade-distorting export practices in the world. This has been secured.?</p><p><i>Nota Bene: this text is an extract from the EC press release on the agricultural dimension of the July 31st agreement.
