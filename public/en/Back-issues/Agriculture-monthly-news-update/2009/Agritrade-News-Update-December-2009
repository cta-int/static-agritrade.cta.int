					<h1>EU concluding a range of FTA negotiations</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>On 15 October 2009 representatives of the EC and South Korea initialled a free-trade agreement (FTA). The EC will formally present the agreement to the EU Council in early 2010, with the agreement expected to have gone through the full approval process by the second half of 2010, when it would enter into force. The Commission press release described the agreement as ‘the most important ever negotiated between the European Union and a third country’ and said that the agreement, ‘estimated to be worth up to €19 billion in new trade for EU exporters, will remove virtually all tariffs between the two economies, as well as many non-tariff barriers’. Catherine Ashton, then the EC trade commissioner, stressed that the new agreement would ‘create new opportunities for European companies in services, manufacturing and agriculture’.</p><p>In terms of the agricultural dimension of the agreement, the EU exports over €1 billion in products every year, making it one of the EU’s most important export markets for agricultural products. The EC’s explanatory memorandum highlights the advantages to EU exporters in the food-and-agricultural sector, but gives no details of the market access offered to Korean food-and-agricultural exporters. While most products will have duty-free access as soon as the agreement enters into force, with other products having duties eliminated within seven years, longer transitional periods will be allowed for sensitive agricultural products. Ultimately the agreement will fully liberalise all EU agricultural exports to Korea except rice, which has been excluded from the FTA by South Korean negotiators, despite the limited EU exports in this area. This has been described as ‘the biggest market liberalisation for EU agricultural exports in years’. It is estimated that there will be savings for EU agricultural exports of ‘€380 million annually on duties for agricultural products’. In this context there is seen to be considerable potential for expanding EU food-and-agricultural exports. The agreement nevertheless remains a defensive agreement, given the wide variety of trade agreements that South Korea has been concluding with ‘strong agricultural exporters such as Chile, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand’. </p><p>The agreement includes commitments to abolish the use of import licences and prohibits the use of export taxes from the date when the agreement enters into force. A committee on trade in goods has also been established which can ‘consider broadening the scope of NTB disciplines’. The agreement also includes a chapter on SPS measures aimed at facilitating trade between the EU and Korea ‘in animals and animal products, plants and plant products’. It includes provisions for setting up a formal dialogue process on SPS issues, a commitment to transparency in the application of SPS measures, and a procedure for recognition of disease-free areas (i.e. areas eligible for exporting products to the other party).</p><p>Regarding other FTA negotiations, press reports have been published giving more detail on the EU-Egypt trade agreement. Under this agreement, it is reported that ‘tariff protection is removed for all fruits and vegetables, except for garlic and strawberries for which quotas of 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes respectively have been established’. For potatoes and onions, quota restrictions on Egyptian exports are to be removed under the agreement, with ‘all other fruits and vegetables … exempt from customs duties, except for some fruits and vegetables whose trade is considered “delicate”: these are tomato, garlic, cucumber, zucchini, artichoke, table grape and strawberry. For these products some limitations are maintained regarding in particular the export calendar.’ Tomato exports will be duty free from 1 November until 30 June, provided that exports respect the minimum entry price for tomatoes. The EU has also extended an existing agricultural trade agreement with Israel. This now grants duty-free access for 95% of all processed agricultural products and 80% of fresh products.</p><p>Meanwhile, press reports from Namibia are warning of the implications for the Namibian beef sector of the priority accorded by the incoming Spanish presidency of the EU to concluding the EU-Mercosur agreement. Under this agreement, Mercosur negotiators are seeking an additional 315,000-tonne beef quota over and above Mercosur’s current share of the Hilton beef quota. The EC, for its part, is looking to a progressive expansion of the beef quota up to a maximum of 116,000 tonnes. Negotiations however remain ongoing, with the EC willing to contemplate a possible offer of a further 100,000 tonnes if Mercosur is more open in allowing EU access to Mercosur markets in industrial goods, and services and investment.</p><p>In the face of this potential increase in competition on EU beef markets (compounding the effects of the recent EU-US agreement to resolve the beef hormone dispute), some Namibian observers are arguing for increased efforts to diversify markets away from the EU, even going so far as to suggest that in this context ‘a signature to the interim EPA would not secure the industry’s long-term survival’.</p><p>FTA negotiations with Central American countries are currently stalled, following internal political developments in a number of countries (notably the military coup in Honduras) and the unresolved issue of Panama’s engagement with the regional process. Meanwhile the EC, in its negotiations with ASEAN countries, is now looking to shift away from the conclusion of a comprehensive region-to-region agreement towards the negotiation of a ‘different arrangement with different ASEAN countries’. Significantly in this context, in an interview with the Jakarta Post, the EC’s lead negotiator, James Moran, director of the Asia Division of the EC External Relations Directorate, claimed that it would not be appropriate for the EU to negotiate an FTA with least-developed Myanmar ‘because the level of development there is so low that there is no way we could have a reciprocal FTA with an economy of that order’.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The question arises of how these various new and pending agreements will affect the future value of ACP trade preferences. This is a particularly relevant question in the context of the ongoing EPA negotiations, as some ACP countries are signing interim EPAs (IEPAs) solely to preserve preferential access to the EU market. As one ACP observer has already asked, what is the value of signing IEPAs to preserve preferential access to the EU market if the value of that preferential access is rapidly being eroded? This is a question which ACP governments contemplating signing an IEPA will need to assess in the light of their underlying motivation for signing, the structure of their country’s current exports to the EU and the current trend towards erosion of the value of traditional ACP trade preferences. </p><p>The SPS provisions included in the EU-South Korea agreement could potentially be of interest to ACP exporters such as Namibia, which on the one hand is in dispute with the EU over recognition of disease-free areas and, on the other hand, finds its beef exports to Korea blocked on SPS grounds.</p><p>The interview in the Jakarta Post with the EC lead negotiator raises the further question of why, if the level of development of Myanmar is such that ‘there is no way [the EU] could have a reciprocal FTA with an economy of that order’, the EC should be so vigorously pursuing FTA arrangements with least-developed ACP countries whose economic status is on a par with Myanmar. </p><p>The question arises of how these various new and pending agreements will affect the future value of ACP trade preferences.

					<h1>Résolution ACP sur les APE</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>A l’occasion de la 90e session du Conseil des ministres ACP, une résolution a été adoptée sur les APE et d’autres sujets liés au commerce. Parmi les enjeux soulevés, la résolution a exhorté la CE « à doter le processus des APE d’une véritable flexibilité, de façon à ce que les régions ACP puissent proposer des offres d’accès au marché inférieures au seuil de 80% des échanges pour une période de transition supérieure à 15 ans » et appelle « à une amélioration des règles d’origine, notamment dans la perspective de favoriser un cumul total au niveau tous-ACP avec des PED voisins. La résolution convient également « de la nécessité d’aborder la libéralisation des produits de base avec prudence, étant donné que la CE continue de recourir aux subventions ». La résolution a également réitéré sa préoccupation sur le fait que les ressources financières disponibles ne seront pas suffisantes pour faire face aux coûts d’ajustement et a appelé à l’adoption de dispositions contraignantes relatives à la coopération au développement au titre des APE.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Les analyses d’autres ALE suggèrent que la couverture des produits peut souvent être nettement inférieure à 80% de l’ensemble des échanges et, en effet, l’ouverture des marchés pour les produits européens peut être d’à peine 54,09% (conformément à l’ALE UE-Mexique : cf. article suivant sur l’étude AFD-GRET). Il semblerait par conséquent qu’il y ait un précédent pour l’adoption de la proposition ACP en vue d’intégrer dans les négociations APE une « véritable flexibilité ». </p>

					<h1>AFD-GRET study shows potential flexibility for current EPA negotiations</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>A comparative study on free-trade agreements (FTAs) involving developing or least-developed countries has been posted by the French Development Agency (AFD) and the Group for Technological Research and Exchange (GRET). The objectives of the study were ‘to feed into French thinking on the different interpretations of Article XXIV and analyse FTA examples that had not been brought as complaints to the WTO’, with the aim of identifying precedents which would allow more flexibility for ACP countries within the framework of the EPA negotiations. The study reviewed 39 agreements notified to the WTO involving developed and developing countries, and four agreements where the parties were developed countries and at least one LDC. Following this stage, 41 of these agreements were selected on the basis of the information available, and were analysed.</p><p>As regards the <b>transition period:</b></p>
<ul>

<li>four agreements had a transition period of greater than 15 years (these included the CARIFORUM-EU EPA, while for all the other interim EPAs the period was shorter, even where the degree of liberalisation varied);</li>

<li>31 agreements included an <b>asymmetric period of liberalisation</b>, including all the agreements involving the EC;</li>

<li>liberalisation was very rapid where ‘the stakes of liberalisation are low’ (moderate trade, with the level of liberalisation required either insignificant or already in place). </li>

</ul>
<p>As regards the <b>degree of liberalisation</b>, the review looks at coverage measures both in terms of the number of tariff lines liberalised and the percentage of total trade covered by the tariff liberalisation commitments (the point of contention in the IEPA negotiations). Five of the agreements had levels of liberalisation lower than 80% of tariff lines (TLs). These were the agreements between:</p>
<ul>

<li>China (35.4% of TLs and 30.3% of trade) and Pakistan (34.6% of TLs and 44.4% of trade). These correspond to the first phase of the agreement, as the second phase was still under negotiation;</li>

<li>European Free Trade Association (EFTA) (80.1% to 95.2% of TLs and 98.96% to 100% of trade) and Tunisia (77% of TLs and 71.7% of trade) ;</li>

<li>India (23.6% of TLs and 75.1% of trade) and Singapore (100%);</li>

<li>Australia (99% of trade) and Papua New Guinea (60% of trade);</li>

<li>Mexico (55.7% of TLs and 54.1 of trade) and the EU (90.3% of TLs and 98.1% of trade).</li>

</ul>
<p>In some instances this meant that the percentage of goods imported from the EU was below 60% (as per the EU-Mexico agreement).</p><p>In terms of liberalisation schedules, certain agreements allowed <b>a degree of flexibility.</b> This was the case for the EU-Tunisia agreement, which has four stages in its liberalisation process, but also for several agreements that have review clauses for a further stage of liberalisation, such as the Chile-Korea agreement, Pakistan-China, EUROMED, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA, comprising Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) or even the interim EPAs currently in force. With the exception of the Ghana-EU EPA and the CARIFORUM-EU EPA (one year and three years respectively for certain products), no agreements were found to include a moratorium, i.e. a clause that allows the party/parties ‘to postpone the start date of the liberalisation period so that the economy of the country concerned can position itself’.</p><p>As regards the <b>standstill clause</b>, ‘all the agreements refer to a basic rate of duty when implementing the liberalisation programme. This generally means the MFN duty or the specific duty applied on the date when the agreement came into effect’. The study does however raise two particular cases: the EU-South Africa TDCA, for which the basic rate of duty dates from 1996, i.e. three years before the agreement came into effect, and for which South Africa was allowed to increase duties on certain products before the old framework was dismantled; and the EU-ESA interim EPA, for which the basic rate of duty is the future COMESA CET, which for example in the case of Madagascar means a resetting of the tariff before liberalisation.</p><p>In some agreements, there was <b>special treatment given to the agricultural sector</b>, as in the US-Morocco agreement (where agricultural products are dealt with in a separate chapter and have specific safeguards), and in the Turkey-Albania and Egypt-Turkey agreements (where the two parties agree concessions on certain products, but ultimately very few agricultural products are liberalised). In the agreements involving the EFTA countries, the agricultural sector was not included, and was dealt with in specific bilateral agreements that are not notified to the WTO, and the agreements involving the Faroe Islands only covered industrial and fisheries products. In other agreements, such as the Jordan-EU or Mexico-EU Association Agreements, a review clause was included for liberalisation of the agriculture sector. According to the study, ‘this is certainly where the margins for flexibility are greatest’, as this sector is known to be sensitive for developing countries. These margins can involve a ‘minor degree of liberalisation, an extension of the transition period just for this sector, special safeguards’, specific agreements for the sector and review clauses. Sixteen of the agreements in the study were identified as containing specific safeguard measures for the agricultural sector.</p><p>In some agreements, <b>maintaining tariff quotas </b>was permitted, as in the agreements involving EFTA.</p><p>The study states that ‘all the agreements include <b>general safeguard measures </b>relating to GATT Article XIX’, and most of the agreements contain bilateral safeguard clauses. Thirty agreements contain safeguard measures that can be mobilised when there is a risk that a big rise in imports may damage the economy. These measures are applicable during the transition period for periods of one to four years, with possible extension of one to three years, whereas the WTO agreement on safeguard measures allows greater flexibility (with possible extension up to six years for developing countries). In 17 of the agreements, there are infant industry safeguard measures, notably in all the EPAs negotiated to date, but these are of limited duration (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire, 2+2 years). The study notes the presence of a ‘<b>scarcity clause</b>’ in 11 of the agreements analysed. The clause is by nature ‘not so much a safeguard [as a measure] to limit the export of these products’; it allows, in the case of the Mexico-EU agreement, for the imposition of export restrictions or taxes particularly when there is a shortage of agricultural products, and raw or essential materials. The EC-Ghana EPA also contains a clause specifying that if the agreement leads to problems of access to foodstuffs or essential commodities, Ghana can take ‘appropriate safeguard measures’.</p><p>As regards the revision clauses, the study notes that many of the agreements include revision clauses mainly for further liberalisation, but that these clauses have few restrictions and ‘do not necessarily lead to negotiations’. </p><p>The MFN clause is seldom included in the FTAs on trade in goods alone, although the EPAs between the EU and the African and Pacific countries and the FTAs among the EFTA countries are exceptions to this. In the New Zealand-Thailand agreement, the MFN clause was in fact rejected. </p><p>The FTAs in the study rarely include a section on ‘<b>development cooperation</b>’: the agreements most advanced in this respect are the EUROMED agreements, which contain provisions on ‘economic, social, cultural and financial cooperation’ and the Chile-China agreement, ‘on cooperation regarding intellectual-property, labour and environmental rights’. ‘Aid for trade’ is only mentioned in the agreements involving EFTA.</p><p>While most of the FTAs contain a provision relating to <b>national treatment</b>, which compels the countries not to favour national production over imports, the ESA-EU agreement includes an interesting clause that specifies that countries in the region may, ‘after authorisation by the EC, favour national products within the framework of fostering the development of domestic production or to support an infant industry’.</p><p>Most of the agreements include clauses that ban <b>restrictions on exports (including export taxes)</b>, however there are some exceptions to this, notably in the EPAs (unrefined sugar for Guyana, tropical woods for Suriname, and exceptions under certain conditions for Zambia, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Papua New Guinea and Fiji) and in the EFTA-Chile and EFTA-Egypt agreements, where the exception covers most processed agricultural products.</p>

			<p>While certain agreements date from the early 1990s, it is important to emphasise that all the agreements that were studied have not to date been brought as complaints to the WTO, and this despite the significant flexibility in some of the agreements when compared to Article XXIV of GATT in respect of the degree of liberalisation of trade.

					<h1>Survey of safeguard provisions in regional and bilateral agreements </h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>The Trade Law Centre for Southern Africa (TRALAC) has posted a survey of safeguard provisions in regional and bilateral agreements, in which it highlights:</p>
<ul>

<li>the importance of safeguard provisions maintaining a balance between preventing serious economic disruption and the underlying purpose of trade liberalisation;</li>

<li>the importance of establishing ‘clear developmental benchmarks and strategies’ within which safeguard provisions are to be deployed;</li>

<li>the importance of establishing clear, simple and transparent implementation modalities for the application of the safeguard measures agreed; </li>

<li>the importance of establishing symmetrical safeguards in agreements between developed economies and groupings of developing and least developed economies;</li>

<li>the need for special attention to be paid to the agricultural sector in designing safeguards, given that ‘agricultural commodity markets are pivotal to the economies of most developing countries’ and are vulnerable to external shocks. In this context the challenge is to draft ‘special safeguards which help stabilise domestic prices in the face of short-term price swings’.</li>

</ul>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Given the importance that this report attaches to drafting special safeguard provisions for agricultural products, the singular absence of specific agricultural safeguard clauses in the provisions of the various interim EPAs should be a matter of some concern. This would appear to be accentuated in the context of the continued, even expanded, deployment of traditional EU policy tools in response to periodic situations of crisis, which are acknowledged to distort production and trade. Recent examples of such deployment include the EC emergency interventions in the dairy sector, which have seen expanded use of export refunds and increased intervention buying. </p>

					<h1>Debates continue on the basis for an EU-west Africa EPA</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>The fourth joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly meeting held on 28 October 2009 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, discussed the difficulties faced in the EPA negotiations. Growing concerns were expressed about the direction the EPA negotiations were taking. EC representatives argued that the only way the ACP can achieve development is through a reciprocal trade regime like the EPA. Representatives from the host parliament however highlighted the differences in the level of development between the EU and the African countries. In this context, considerable priority is being accorded to first reinforcing regional integration.</p><p>A revised market access offer was tabled by west African negotiators at the negotiating session from 23-24 October in Abidjan. This was a product of extensive internal consultations in west Africa. ‘A large number of products … were reclassified from the exclusion to liberalisation lists. This includes certain animal products (four products), vegetable products (83 products), animal- and vegetable-fat products (seven products) and prepared foodstuffs and beverages (18 products). However, according to ECOWAS Commissioner for Trade and Industry, Alhaji Mohammed Daramy, this revised west African market access offer was ‘conditional on the commitment of the EU to support the EPA development programme’. </p><p>Meanwhile at a press conference in Abidjan on 13 November 2009, Ivorian representatives argued that their initialling of the IEPA had avoided a loss of market share and competitiveness of its products in the European Union market. This, it was held, was not an insignificant development, since Côte d’Ivoire exports more than €610 million of merchandise to the EU market annually. However, despite the initialling of the IEPA, differences of view remain on how to move the EPA negotiations forward. Against this background some felt that the signing of a comprehensive EU-west Africa EPA was still some way off. </p><p>On 19 November Nigeria’s National Indicative Programme was signed, with some 16% of the NIP (€105 million) allocated in support of trade and regional integration, the EPA development programme and improvement of competitiveness of the private sector.</p>

			<p>Reinforcing regional integration in west Africa constitutes a major problem for governments in the region, with a multiplicity of unconventional non-tariff barriers (NTBs, e.g. informal road blocks) and divergent policy perspectives hindering the development of regional trade.

					<h1>Concerns expressed over costs and benefits of IEPA </h1>

												09 December 2009

				</header>







		
		
					<p>In a study carried out earlier this year on the impact of signing the EPA on the economy of Cameroon, losses of 775 billion CFA francs (€1.2 billion) were projected at the regional level over the next 12 years. These losses included some FCFA 295 billion (€450 million) in losses for Cameroon. In a context where customs duties represent almost 40% of the fiscal revenue of most central African countries, the fiscal effects of the EPA would also be considerable. A study by the Cameroon Ministry of Finance revealed that the EPA between EU and Cameroon would lead to losses in customs revenue of up to €197 million between 2010 and 2023, with this reaching €356 million by 2030. These studies remain relevant, given the state of play in the central Africa EPA negotiations, and resolution of these issues remains of considerable importance to local producers.</p><p>The impact of the elimination of tariffs on imports from the EU also needs to be taken into account. Currently intra-regional trade in CEMAC is insignificant, accounting for only 0.28% per annum according to the Fondation pour le renforcement des capacités en Afrique centrale (ACBF). Major efforts to counter corruption, counterfeiting and fraud in customs procedures are needed before regional trade in central Africa can be expanded.</p><p>Concerns have also been expressed over the future value of duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market, given the very strict hygiene and quality standards applied by the EU. It is felt that in reality only a tiny portion of Cameroon’s exports will finally reach the EU market. Concerns have also been raised about the future value of EU trade preferences in the banana sector, given the deal pending with Latin American banana suppliers on the fringes of the Doha Development Round.</p><p>Nevertheless, according to the EPA update in the November 2009 <i>Trade Negotiations Insights</i>, the central Africa-EU EPA negotiations are set to resume, following informal consultations in Brussels on 2 October. Areas for continued negotiations include market access coverage and transition periods, legal commitments for EU EPA development support, the non-execution clause, rules of origin, the MFN clause and provisions related to temporary movement of people.</p><p>Meanwhile the Cameroon interim EPA was notified to the WTO. The process of ‘tariff dismantling’ is set to begin in January 2010. It is unclear how this process is to be harmonised with the ongoing central Africa-EU EPA negotiations process.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>As in other regions, fiscal adjustment issues are a major source of concern in central Africa. Getting to grips with the issue of extending effective support to fiscal adjustment in central Africa could go a long way towards addressing concerns over the impact of reciprocal tariff-elimination commitments on the local economy.</p><p>The issue of preference erosion is likely to be a more complicated issue to address. To date, banana exporters from Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire have been expanding their share of ACP banana exports to the EU. With the impending reduction of tariffs for ‘dollar banana’ suppliers to €114 per tonne (down from €176/tonne), issues related to the underlying cost competitiveness of Cameroonian banana exports will arise. An important issue in this regard will be the ability of the local industry to set in place effective programmes to utilise Cameroon’s share of the proposed €190 million of ‘Banana Accompanying Measures’ programme support, which is scheduled to be agreed as part of a wider banana deal. </p>

					<h1>Comprehensive ESA-EU EPA still some time off</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>November’s edition of <i>Trade Negotiations Insights</i> reports that a comprehensive ESA-EU EPA is now unlikely this year, as no further negotiating sessions have been held since the signing of the four country-specific IEPAs in August 2009. According to ESA representatives, ‘the outstanding disagreements on safeguard and infant industry clauses, and on export taxes, need to be resolved with the EU in order for the remaining seven of the region’s countries to sign on to IEPAs.’ The issue of the rendezvous clause also needs to be resolved. </p><p>Issues related to ‘some modification to tariffs on sensitive items’ and the maintenance of TRQs in four main areas have however been largely resolved, according to TNI reports. </p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>A notable feature across African ACP regions is the extent to which IEPA provisions linked to the EU’s new policy focus on removing non-tariff barriers to trade (including limiting the use of traditional trade-policy tools) have become a matter of contention in the finalisation of the IEPAs. Many of these issues were only tabled for discussion at the end of 2007, and the full implications of these provisions were not always reviewed prior to the initialling of the IEPAs. With African governments often lacking the budgetary resources to use the kind of financial tools which the EU routinely deploys in pursuit of agricultural policy objectives, greater recourse needs to be made to the use of trade-policy tools. These include import licensing, infant industry provisions, special agricultural safeguards and export taxes in support of agricultural development of food security objectives. Such tools are quite different to non-tariff barriers to trade such as illegal road blocks and corrupt customs practices. Against this background, a more thorough review of EC positions on these issues would appear to be needed. </p>

					<h1>EC proposes action to improve functioning of food supply chain	</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>According to an EC press release, ‘the recent sharp decline in agricultural commodity prices alongside persistently high consumer food prices’ has raised concerns over the ‘functioning of the food supply chain in the EU’. Against this background the EC has agreed a communication proposing ‘concrete actions to improve (the) functioning of the food supply chain in the EU’. In part these proposals aim to improve ‘commercial relationships between actors of the chain’ to the ultimate benefit of all concerned.</p><p>Commissioner Fischer Boel, in her blog, highlighted three main thrusts of the communication: the importance of the newly launched European food prices monitoring tool; the importance of boosting ‘farmers’ bargaining power in the supply chain’ and the importance of farmers working together. More specifically in the communication the EC identifies:</p>
<ul>

<li>‘significant tensions in contractual relations between actors of the chain, stemming from their diversity and differences in bargaining power’;</li>

<li>a ‘lack of transparency of prices along the food chain’;</li>

<li>‘increased volatility of commodity process’.</li>

</ul>
<p>It further notes the continue fragmentation of EU food markets.</p><p>Specifically the communication notes that the Commission proposes to:</p>
<ul>

<li>‘promote sustainable and market-based relationships between stakeholder of the food supply chain’, by identifying ‘unfair contractual practices stemming from asymmetries in bargaining power’ and monitoring ‘potential abuses’, by working with national competition authorities to monitor the functioning of the food supply chain and by drafting ‘standard contracts with stakeholders from the different sectors’;</li>

<li>‘increase transparency in the food supply chain’ by establishing a ‘European food prices monitoring tool’, improving ‘oversight of agricultural commodity derivatives market’ so as ‘to contain volatility and speculation’. The Commission is also proposing the establishment at the national level of ‘price comparison services’ to allow consumers to compare prices of different retailers;</li>

<li>‘foster the integration of the internal market for food and the competitiveness of all sectors of the food supply chain’ by removing measures which ‘impede cross-border trade’ and ‘force’ retailers to source locally, looking at ‘how farmers’ bargaining position can be strengthened’.</li>

</ul>
<p>A report is to be prepared on the effectiveness of these measures by the end of 2010.</p><p>The EC has also posted the Commission staff working papers which went into the formulation of the EC communication on the functioning of the food supply chain in the EU (see sources below).</p><p>The EC initiative to improve the functioning of the food supply chain has been welcomed by European farmers’ group COPA-COGECA, who however also called for ‘much stronger measures’ to be urgently introduced. In its press release, COPA-COGECA argued that ‘the EU food market is dominated by large retailers, and farmers’ share in retail food prices is continuing to be eroded’. The Secretary-General of COPA-COGECA, Pekka Personen, called for ‘measures to facilitate the concentration of supply to make sure that farmers can have a better position on the market’, as well as measures ‘to address the problems of late payments, market abuses and distortions of competition in the food chain’.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>EU concerns over the functioning of the food supply chain find a strong echo in ACP countries, where inequalities in power relationships can mean that ACP agricultural producers obtain only a tiny percentage of the final sale value of the food-and-agricultural products they grow. EU investigations and policy responses may carry important lessons for ACP countries in their own efforts to strengthen the negotiating position of agricultural producers in both national and international supply chains.</p><p>However, it needs to be recognised that ACP governments tend to face severe budgetary restrictions on the types of policy tools they can use in addressing inequalities in power relationships in the various supply chains in which national producers are engaged. This means that often trade-policy tools, such as the use of import licences, are the only means available to address inequalities in power along the supply chain.</p><p>A case in point is the use of import licensing in the Namibian horticultural sector, where this tool has been effectively used as part of a wider policy to effectively encourage greater local sourcing of fruit and vegetables by major retailers and traders. This has seen the domestic supply of fruit and vegetables increase from 5% of local consumption to around 25% in only five years. Against this background, more nuanced approaches are needed in dealing with non-tariff barriers to trade.</p>

					<p>Discussing the future of rural areas in Europe on 29 October 2009 in Sweden, Commissioner Fischer Boel highlighted an increasingly important EU policy concern, namely to ‘make sure that real crises don’t cause excessive damage to our production base’. She argued that ‘if we allow our own production base to be damaged by crises, and if in this way we allow too much of global food production to be concentrated in a few areas of the world, we’re giving a hostage to fortune. A serious disease outbreak in one or more of these areas – or bad weather – would send the world’s food markets into meltdown’. This, she argued, meant a continued need for ‘a Common Agricultural Policy which allows farmers to breathe the stimulating air of the marketplace, but which also helps the sector through very difficult times’.</p><p>In a similar vein, addressing a workshop on 10 November 2009 on the future of CAP after 2013, Commissioner Fischer Boel asserted that ‘the CAP may need further changes for the future, but these changes must strengthen it, not weaken it’. She argued that in future agricultural production would need ‘an increase of between 70% and 100%’. In this context, she stressed the importance of not neglecting the EU’s ‘domestic production base’.</p><p>The Commissioner argued that in moving EU policy forward, ‘complete deregulation’ was not appropriate, but rather that emphasis should be placed on ‘giving farmers the freedom to respond competitively and creatively to market signals’. She maintained that ‘it <i>is</i> possible to have a safety net that doesn’t discourage competitiveness, and that’s what we need’. </p><p>Commissioner Fischer Boel further argued that if farmers were over-regulated, this would transfer production overseas, and farmers and policy makers would have to ‘explain to the public why we’re generating more greenhouse gases by importing more food – food produced to environmental standards … lower than our own’. On this basis she argued for ‘green growth’ in building on and strengthening the CAP in future. In this context she stressed the importance of designing a CAP with ‘clear goals to which the public can sign up’. </p><p>Meanwhile a group of leading agricultural economists has published a declaration proposing a radical and fundamental reform of the CAP that involves a much clearer definition of what should be done at the national and EU levels, and the progressive abolition of direct-aid payments to farmers and their replacement by social expenditures which are much more clearly targeted on the rural poor. The declaration drew an immediate and sharp response from the EU farmers’ organisation, COPA-COGECA, which argued that food security considerations, direct payments to farmers and traditional market management tools should remain central to any future CAP. The only point of agreement with the declaration was on the need for measures to strengthen producers’ bargaining power within the food supply chain in order to prevent any abuse of market power by food retailers and manufacturers.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>In recent speeches Commissioner Fischer Boel has been making the case for limiting the extent to which the EU agricultural sector is exposed to the unrestrained effects of market forces. She has highlighted the importance of maintaining the production base, despite periodic crisis on world markets. In pursuing this policy objective, the EC is making increasing use of financial instruments of support within the framework of moves towards increased tariff liberalisation in the agro-food sector. However, these moves towards tariff liberalisation are pursued not in a dogmatic manner, but in the light of the underlying concern to maintain the agricultural production base in the EU and the progressive development of financial and other instruments of support. In addition to this, where necessary the EU continues to use trade-policy tools which have trade-distorting effects where it is seen as essential to the continued maintenance of production in crisis-affected sectors (e.g. in the dairy sector).</p><p>These underlying EU concerns over ‘food security’ (particularly in the dairy sector) place the current IEPA debates on the dismantling of non-tariff measures regulating trade in food-and-agricultural products (such as import-licensing arrangements, infant industry protection and special agricultural safeguards) in a new light. Surely, in a context where ACP governments share EU concerns over food security, but lack the financial means to extensively deploy financial support instruments to sustain the basis for domestic agricultural production, greater tolerance should be shown towards the continued use of trade-policy tools designed to sustain and promote the development of the agricultural production? </p>

					<h1>EU launches WTO challenge to Chinese use of export taxes</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>On 4 November 2009 the EC ‘requested the establishment of a WTO panel on Chinese export restrictions on a number of key raw materials’. The EC believes that these restrictions, which affect ‘key raw materials such as yellow phosphorus, bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon metal, silicon carbide and zinc’ are a clear breach of international trade rules and ‘specific commitments which China signed up to as part of the WTO Accession Protocol’. However it is the measures not covered by China’s accession agreement which the EC is challenging. Chinese export duties are imposed on 373 tariff lines at the 8-digit level, with imports of these products into the EU worth an estimated €4.5 billion in 2008. The USA and Mexico have also requested a panel on the same issue.</p><p>Catherine Ashton, then the EC Trade Commissioner, argued that ‘China’s restrictions on raw materials continue to distort competition and increase global prices, making conditions for our companies even more difficult in this economic climate’. This particularly the case for those raw materials which cannot be found elsewhere. These measures give value-added processing industries in China ‘an unfair advantage’. The Chinese measures mainly affect the EU steel, aluminium and chemical industries, representing ‘about 4% of EU industrial activity and around 500,000 jobs’.</p><p>The EC request for a panel follows on from formal WTO consultations that were requested on 23 June 2009 but which proved unsuccessful.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>EU concerns over the use of export taxes by the Chinese authorities are understandable, given their impact on major sectors of the EU economy. However, to a certain extent ACP governments have found themselves embroiled in this type of dispute through the EC’s attempts to introduce prohibitions on the use of export taxes into IEPAs. It should be noted that at the WTO the EU is not challenging all Chinese export taxes, but only those not covered by the provisions of China’s WTO accession agreement. </p><p>Against this background, a more nuanced approach to prohibitions on the use of export taxes would appear to be warranted, particularly with regard to agricultural products. It should be recalled that a major policy preoccupation of ACP governments is supporting movement up the value chain, to reduce dependence on exports of raw materials. Given this policy focus and the limited access which ACP governments have to financial incentive-based policy tools, a legitimate role for the use of export taxes would appear to exist.</p>

					<h1>WTO DG upbeat against a background of general gloom</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy has called for text-based talks, if progress is to be made in the Doha negotiations. He argued, amidst a mood of gloom amongst delegates, that progress to date had been simply too slow. Reporting on the state of play in the agricultural negotiations in November, DG Lamy highlighted the twin-track approach being adopted, consisting of a template approach and informal consultations in small groups. He maintained that the template approach was ‘advancing well’, with the ‘identification of base date and appropriate tables’ approaching completion. This it was argued would provide the basis for ‘the preparation of templates to be used in scheduling. The small group discussions meanwhile were focusing on ‘bracketed and otherwise annotated issues in the draft modalities and associated documentation’.</p><p>This presentation of progress to date came against the background of concerns that ‘time for the round is running out’ and ‘the package on the table is beginning to unravel’. Symptomatic of this unravelling were held to be US efforts to ‘protect an additional 2% of agricultural tariff lines as “sensitive”’. </p><p>Despite DG Lamy’s optimistic report to the WTO General Council in the run-up to the Ministerial Council at the end of November, ICTSD reports little overall progress in the small group discussions called by the Chair to facilitate forward movement in the negotiations process.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Overall little substantive progress appears to have been made in the negotiations to date. However, this is to a certain extent deceptive, with the likelihood being that once an agreement is in sight, progress will be made rapidly in parallel across a multiplicity of fronts. Against this background it would appear to be essential for the ACP to make sure that at all stages their essential interests and concerns are being effectively addressed. </p>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>At the 90th session of the ACP Council of Ministers, a resolution was adopted on the 7th session of the Ministerial conference. The resolution expressed general concerns over the process through which the negotiations were being carried forward. Specifically with regard to agricultural issues, the resolution called for:</p>
<ul>

<li>‘a specific article on agricultural commodities’ in line with previous texts;</li>

<li>any agreement on modalities to take account of ‘the need for appropriate policy space’ that allows ‘ACP countries to pursue agricultural policies that are supportive of their development goals, poverty reduction strategies, food security and livelihood concerns’;</li>

<li>modalities which ensure ‘the maintenance of long-standing preferential access’ and which foster ‘improved market access for the agricultural products of ACP countries, both in primary and processed forms’;</li>

<li>modalities which adequately address all ACP concerns;</li>

<li>the resolution of issues related to ‘long-standing preferences and preference erosion … by means of trade-based solutions over an implementation period of at least ten years’ and for the adoption of the ‘necessary accompanying measures to enable the preference-dependent countries to adapt to a liberalised trading environment during and beyond the transition period’;</li>

<li>no reduction of ambition with regard to commitments on reducing domestic agricultural support programmes.</li>

</ul>
<p>Additional provisions dealing with banana, sugar and cotton issues were included in the WTO resolution (see accompanying articles on ACP resolutions on bananas, sugar and cotton issues).</p><p>The resolution also called for an ‘early harvest’ on issues affecting LDCs and the full accommodation of small and vulnerable economies.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The resolution represents the consensus position in the ACP on these issues and constitutes the assertion of ACP concerns on these agricultural issues in the run-up to the 7th WTO Ministerial conference. It provides an effective benchmark against which to judge the outcome of the forthcoming Ministerial meeting. However, it should be noted that WTO Director-General Lamy has stressed that the forthcoming meeting is not essentially about the Doha Round negotiations, but more about the day-to-day functioning of the WTO as an institution regulating international trade relations. This would suggest that there are unlikely to be any major breakthroughs on issues of concern to the ACP at the forthcoming Ministerial meeting.</p>

					<h1>Some setbacks but overall good times for Illovo Sugar</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>Output projections for Zambia Sugar’s year to March 2010 have been cut from 420,000 tonnes to 350,000 tonnes. This is attributed to ‘off-season rains in the early part of the growing period’. However, production of 350,000 tonnes will still be a record for the company. In the current season the company reports that ‘export demand from regional markets has been buoyant, with good realisations being achieved as a result of increased world sugar prices, whilst preferential quotas into the European Union have been supplied in full’. The company expects lower prices for EU sugar from October 2009 to be ‘offset by increased market access’. Meanwhile, Illovo, the owner of Zambia Sugar, reported an 18% rise in first-half profits on its operations in Malawi. This has contributed to an increase in headline earnings across the Illovo Group of between 25% and 30% compared to the previous year.</p><p>In parallel to Illovo’s performance, British Sugar’s owner, Associated British Foods (which also has a 51% share in Illovo) has announced an increase in pre-tax profits, taking them to £655 million in the latest financial year. ‘Overall ABF group revenue was up 12% ... and adjusted operating profit [was] up 8%’. This improved performance follows on from the finalisation of the 2010 beet contract, ‘which meant that the price paid to growers would remain unchanged next season’.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The financial performance of southern Africa’s sugar industry is increasingly interlinked with the financial performance of EU sugar companies, given the pattern of investments which has emerged in the region in recent years. While currently both southern African sugar growers and sugar mills are benefiting from high global prices which have prevented the full effects of EU reductions in administratively determined prices from being transmitted through to the market price paid, in the years beyond 2012 this financial performance is likely to diverge. This raises challenges with regard to the utilisation of EC ‘sugar-protocol accompanying measures’ programme support. Will these funds be used in the coming period to strengthen the financial position of sugar out-growers in southern Africa, in preparation for the likely reduction of EU prices once price guarantees for ACP sugar are eliminated from October 2012? The deployment of accompanying-measures funding in such a manner would be wholly consistent with the trajectory of internal EU policy in the dairy and fruit-and-vegetable sectors, where the issue of the unequal distribution of power along the supply chain is most sorely felt within the EU. </p>

			<p>The measures called for by ACP Ministers are intended to ensure that in developing its policy positions on sugar in both bilateral negotiations and the multilateral WTO negotiations, the EU fully takes account of ACP interests in the sugar sector.

					<h1>Sugar prices expected to remain buoyant </h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>Australian sugar analysts are suggesting that global sugar prices ‘will stay fairly firm for the next 12, maybe 18 months’. Prices have risen 98% in the past year following ‘adverse weather in Brazil and India’ and increased global demand. However it is expected that in the longer term, ‘high prices will encourage increased production’. According to German researcher F.O. Licht, ‘global sugar consumption will climb 2.6% to 165.4 million metric tonnes in the season that began on 1 October, exceeding production for a second year’. While there has been some expansion of production in response to higher prices, this will only reduce the supply deficit from 10.7 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes. The stock-to-consumption ratio is expected to drop to about 35%. Meanwhile press reports based on technical analysis by LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago suggest that world sugar prices ‘may jump as much as 19% to 27 US cents’, although it suggests there is an equal chance that it will fall 12% to 20 cents/lb. </p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The high world market prices for sugar have created a situation where for some ACP sugar exporters it is currently more profitable to export to regional markets than to the EU. However, for certain major suppliers this shift in exports is not taking place, since contractual commitments to supply EU importers have been made. One impact of high world market sugar prices, however, is that ACP exporters are currently being insulated from the full effects of reductions in the guaranteed price for ACP sugar. On the basis of current projects, this situation looks likely to continue at least until October 2011. The critical issue for ACP sugar exporters then becomes what happens after this date in the context of the removal of EU price guarantees from 1 October 2012. Clearly ACP sugar exporters will need to set in place long-term sugar supply arrangements if they are to continued to be insulated from the full effects of the reductions in the EU guaranteed price for ACP sugar and the eventual elimination of price guarantees. </p>

					<h1>Resolution of banana dispute pending</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>ICTSD reports intensified negotiations to conclude a banana deal, with a deal expected before the 30 November WTO Ministerial meeting. The deal, nominally entitled the ‘Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas’ is expected to resemble the July 2008 arrangement. This would see the duty paid by Latin American suppliers fall progressively from the current €176/tonne to €114/t after seven years. The new agreement would ‘mandate that bananas receive “stand-alone” treatment and be excluded from the Tropical Products list – a list of products that will receive the “fullest liberalisation”, settle all pending disputes with Latin American exporters, and provide a “credit clause” to mark the lowered MFN tariff as the EU’s final market access commitment in the Doha Round’. In addition, if no deal is reached in the multilateral trade talks by 2013, the process of tariff reductions will be temporarily halted after two years. Reports of a pending deal have seen the share value of Fyffes plc increase by 8%. In contrast it is feared that the deal will result in a 12% decline in banana prices and a decline of 14% in ACP banana exports to the EU. This, it is feared, could be ‘devastating’ for the economies of the Windward Islands. Against this background ‘Britain’s shoppers are being urged to keep faith with fair trade Caribbean banana growers’. </p><p>According to ICTSD the EU will provide ‘a substantial amount of aid through “Banana Accompanying Measures”’ reported to consist of €190 million ‘beyond the support offered through the European Development Fund’.</p><p>At the ACP Ministerial meeting on 19 November a resolution was adopted which:</p>
<ul>

<li>reaffirmed ‘the serious social, economic and political dislocation that could result from the destruction of the banana industry in ACP countries’;</li>

<li>reiterated the ACP view that bananas should have ‘a separate tariff treatment in the DDA modalities on agriculture’ and should not be subject to treatment as a ‘Tropical Product’, and that the EU and ACP should ‘jointly agree on the modalities for addressing preference erosion products/tropical products in the agriculture negotiations’;</li>

<li>stressed that the banana deal should be implemented as an integral part of the Doha Round package;</li>

<li>argued that the current EU offer to MFN suppliers exceeded what was necessary to ‘fulfil the EC’s obligations under Article XXVIII of the GATT and for complying with the WTO Appellate Body’s ruling’;</li>

<li>called for the ‘implementation of tariff cuts in instalments spread over at least 10 years’, a three-year moratorium following the first reduction in the tariff, the allocation of €250 million to the ‘Banana Accompanying Measures’ programme, with a review of the situation of ACP banana suppliers in 2013 to determine whether additional resources are required.</li>

</ul>

					<h1>Differentiating EU beef products on animal welfare ground</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>On 28 October 2009 the EC adopted a report on animal welfare labelling, aimed at making it ‘easier for consumers to identify and choose welfare-friendly products’. This would, it is hoped, ‘give an economic incentive to producers to improve the welfare of animals’. The EU Health Commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, argued that ‘if successfully communicated, higher animal welfare standards offer the prospects of a win-win situation for both consumers and producers. Consumers looking for welfare-friendly products can more easily identify them, and producers applying higher standards can market their products more effectively’.</p><p>Options for animal welfare labelling include:</p>
<ul>

<li>‘the establishment of requirements for the voluntary use of animal welfare claims’;</li>

<li>‘the establishment of a voluntary Community Animal Welfare Label open for all to use, provided they meet the criteria’;</li>

<li>the drafting of guidelines for animal welfare labelling and quality schemes.</li>

</ul>
<p>The EC report has launched a political debate over animal welfare labelling. Specific proposals will only emerge at the end of this process of debate.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>While animal welfare labelling to enable consumers to differentiate meat products based on animal welfare considerations forms part of the general evolution in European consumption towards the purchase of ‘luxury purchase’, differentiated, food products, the question arises whether the standards applied will be generic, and hence open to all meat producers regardless of region of origin, or whether the definition of the animal welfare standards to be applied will rather be Eurocentric in origin, and hence come to constitute a means of discriminating against imported meat products which in reality meet similar animal welfare standards. A secondary question relates to the certification requirements linked to animal welfare labelling. Will these certification requirements come to impose additional financial burdens on ACP exporters of quality meat products, produced from animals raised in line with EU animal welfare standards, or will all producers have equal access to the certification process at equal cost?</p><p>These are important questions, since in future they will directly impinge on the ability of ACP producers to participate competitively in an increasingly fragmented and differentiated EU meat product market. Some ACP suppliers are already actively pursuing strategies to meet the new challenges of effectively differentiating their beef products on quality grounds. While this is yielding substantial additional commercial benefits, it is vitally important that the costs of meeting new EU standards, be they welfare or hygiene standards, are kept to a minimum. These considerations need to be incorporated into the design of any new EU animal welfare labelling schemes. </p>

					<h1>Maize trade patterns changing</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>A USDA FAS circular has been posted which analyses the changing patterns of global trade in maize. It finds that since 2004/05 China’s and Argentina’s share of global maize exports has shrunk. In China the virtual elimination of maize exports is seen as being a product of the elimination of export support policies, high internal prices and rapidly expanding domestic feed demand. In Argentina policy uncertainty, persistent droughts and the growing profitability of soybeans ‘have all contributed to lower production and less exportable supplies’. In contrast the market shares of Brazil, South Africa, the EU and Ukraine are all expanding. However, with the exception of Brazil, this expansion is largely targeted at neighbouring regional markets where ‘a comparative freight and logistical advantage’ exists.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>It is unclear to what extent African ACP markets are seen as neighbouring ‘regional markets’ for the EU under this USDA analysis. Certainly in the wheaten products sector, African markets have become of growing significance to EU exporters as competition has intensified on traditional markets in North Africa and the Middle East. This intensified competition has emerged as a result of investment in local processing facilities to meet local tastes and the growing supply of this demand from newly emergent exporters (e.g. Ukraine) or an increasingly competitive Brazil. </p>

					<h1>ACP resolution on cotton</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>At the 90th session of the ACP Council of Ministers a resolution was adopted on cotton issues ‘deploring the lack of reaction to the proposals of the African cotton-producing countries’ tabled in the WTO ‘with a view to total abolition’ of cotton subsidies provided by OECD producers. The resolution calls on the EU to ‘demonstrate more ambition in their support for the positions of the co-authors of the Cotton Initiative and the ACP Group at the WTO’. The resolution goes on to reaffirm that ACP believe that cotton issues are ‘one of the major indicators of the development component of the ongoing round’.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>It should be recalled that some observers have suggested that WTO negotiations were collapsed over the agricultural safeguard issue, specifically to avoid highlighting the difficulties faced around the totemic issue of cotton subsidies. In large part this is an issue where the USA takes centre stage and the EU plays only a supporting role. The ACP complaint appears to be that the role currently being played by the EU is not supportive enough of ACP and cotton initiative positions.</p>

					<p>The EC quarterly report on the dairy market prepared for the 19 October 2009 EU Agriculture Council meeting reported a steady improvement in the overall situation on the EU dairy market, with prices of dairy products increasing. ‘EU average butter and SMP prices are now well above intervention levels, and quantities bought into intervention are minimal’. The report notes that average EU milk prices reached 26 euro cents in August. In terms of supply, overall milk supply in the first half of 2009 remained at the same level as 2008, despite a 1% increase in the milk production quota.</p><p><b>EU and world dairy commodity markets</b></p><table class="renderedtable" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<p>In terms of intervention buying, 83,000 tonnes of butter have been bought into intervention, 7% of production in the first seven months of 2009 (4.3% of annual production). Some 283,000 tonnes of SMP have been bought into intervention, equivalent to 42% of SMP production in the first seven months and 30% of annual production. The high protein intervention buying is linked to ‘lower demand for drinking milk and high-value products’.</p><p>Following the Agriculture Council meeting on 28 October, the EC confirmed it would allow EU member states to provide up to €15,000 in state aid to EU dairy farmers to stabilise their incomes. This follows on from the amendment of the Temporary Crisis Framework adopted in January 2009. The measure is aimed at easing ‘the serious cash flow problems which some farmers are experiencing’. This measure will absorb the €280 million of additional assistance to dairy farmers agreed at the EU Agriculture Council meeting.</p><p>Following the decision of European Council of Finance Ministers at their meeting of 19 November 2009, the new financial allocations for support to the dairy sector have now been released.</p>

			<p>Developments in the dairy sector highlight the EC’s continued willingness to use traditional agricultural-support policy tools, where the market situation requires the use of such measures, despite the recognised trade-distorting effects of these measures (see tables above illustrating why the EU still has need of traditional policy tools). It also highlights the ongoing policy commitment to insulating EU producers from the worst effects of global market instability. However, as the group of leading agricultural economists pointed out in their declaration on the future of the CAP (see article on ‘The future of the CAP’), this means that non-EU producers, particularly producers in developing countries, carry the main burden of adjusting to global price instability.</p><p>This raises the question of what policy tools ACP governments should be allowed to retain in place, so that they are able to insulate their agricultural producers from the worst effects of global price instability and thus avoid any undermining of their domestic agricultural production base.</p>

					<h1>Farmers’ perspectives of the future of the EU dairy sector</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>On 10 November 2009, farmers’ leaders provided their views on the future of the EU dairy sector to the EC High Level Expert Group on Milk. Considerable emphasis was placed on strengthening the bargaining position of dairy farmers in the supply chain by promoting a concentration of supply through cooperatives and farmers’ associations. COPA President Padraig Walshe argued that farmers would ‘like to see the single Common Market Organisation offering producers more opportunities to come together, for the sector’s key players to organise themselves and even sign transparent agreements between themselves’. ‘Balanced contractual relations properly negotiated between milk producers and dairies’ were seen as an essential part of dealing with ‘growing market volatility’. This point was reinforced by NFU Dairy Board chairman Gwyn Jones, who argued that ‘contracts are a fundamental factor in ensuring fairness in the dairy supply chain’. He maintained that ‘the creation of the High Level Group by the European Commission provided a unique opportunity to examine the structures and policy interventions that may be required at EU and member state level to provide the foundations on which the dairy sector, and especially dairy farm businesses, can thrive’. This was felt to be particularly important given the proposed ending of milk quotas in 2015. At this point, he commented, ‘all decisions about the location of production, scale and distribution will be taken by milk buyers through the contracts they offer’. This, it was argued, ‘could further erode the bargaining power of milk producers and opens up the risk of further abuses of power’.</p><p>Farmers’ leaders however also argued for maintaining and properly managing the existing market management tools, such as export refunds and intervention buying.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>The importance of getting to grips with the issue of unequal power relationships within supply chains is an issue of vital importance to agricultural development in ACP countries. However, the policy tools available to ACP governments differ considerably from the policy tools available to the EC. Put simply, generally ACP governments lack the financial resources to use the types of financial support tools used by the EU to rebalance power relations within specific supply chains. More commonly in those ACP countries where supply chain issues are taken up and addressed, more active use is made of trade-policy tools. A case in point is the use of import-licensing arrangements in the Namibian horticulture sector, which are <i>de facto</i> used to rebalance power relationships between producers, traders and retailers with the aim of fostering a process of dialogue, which expands local production for local markets. In the case of Namibia this policy has proved extremely successful, leading to a fivefold increase in the supply of fresh horticultural products to the local market at a minimal additional cost to consumers and with little or no trade-distorting consequences. </p><p>The important point to note in this context is that in addressing unequal power relationships in food supply chains, the policy tools available to EU and ACP authorities vary considerably, with the policy space needing to be retained in ACP countries to allow the deployment of those policy tools available, in order to address an issue which is of common concern to both EU and ACP authorities. </p>

					<h1>Carbon effects of international trade debated</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

					<p>The debate on the role of the international food trade in climate change has intensified, with statements from the Archbishop of Canterbury calling on consumers to ‘eat local’. This has prompted a response highlighting the energy intensity of ‘local’ greenhouse-based vegetable production and the carbon effects of internal fruit-and-vegetable transportation. It is argued that the international trade in fruit and vegetables would ‘make hardly any impact on climate change but would harm over one million people in sub-Saharan Africa’. According to opinion pieces carried on the Guardian website, ‘air-freighted fruit and vegetables contribute less than one-tenth of 1% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions’, with far greater emissions occurring as a result of ‘domestic transport of food goods within the United Kingdom’.</p><p>Meanwhile in South Africa a major multiple retailer is working with farmers to ensure that its fresh produce is produced in increasingly environmentally friendly ways. The ‘Farming for the future’ scheme, which ‘focuses on building and maintaining healthy soil’, is set to be rolled out from the end of 2009, with the aim of ensuring that all locally grown fresh produce meets the farming practices laid down under the scheme by 2012. </p><p>The debate on the role of the international food trade in climate change has intensified, with statements from the Archbishop of Canterbury calling on consumers to ‘eat local’.

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Consumers in Europe and affluent consumers in developing countries are increasingly searching for products which are produced in ways that are sustainable and minimise the damage to both the local and global environment. With major retailers increasingly responding to this trend, producers in ACP countries will need to revise their production practices if they are to continue to serve premium-priced components of the market. This represents a substantial challenge for the coming period, in support of which expanding ‘aid for trade’ allocations could usefully be deployed. </p>

					<h1>FAO round-up of global rice market developments</h1>

			<h4>
			
												09 December 2009
										</h4>

				</header>







		
		
					<p>FAO has reduced its forecast for global paddy rice production in 2009 by 21.3 million tonnes to 668 million tonnes, 3% less than 2008. This reflects ‘unfavourable climatic conditions in northern hemisphere Asian countries’. However although less favourable growing conditions have affected Africa’s rice growing areas, production is expected to be ‘close to the outstanding 25.4 million tonnes gathered in 2008’. This reflects ‘an expansion drive from governments and renewed interest in the sector from both institutional and private investors’. The round-up adds that ‘particularly good crops are forecast in Madagascar and Mozambique, as well as Mali and Nigeria’, but that drought has however impacted on production in eastern Africa. In the Caribbean, larger crops are reported in the Dominican Republic, while a production decline is expected in Guyana. Meanwhile paddy production is projected to expand in the EU27.</p><p>In terms of trade in rice, a 2% expansion to 30.7 million tonnes is projected for 2009, with the EU being among the regions increasing their imports of rice. Trade is then expected to contract 1% in 2010 to 30.3 million tonnes. Global rice stocks meanwhile have increased to 121.4 million tonnes, an 11% increase. Stocks are expected to build up in several major importing countries, as well as in rice-exporting countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand and the United States. World rice reserves now cover 3.2 months of global rice utilisation, with a stock-to-use ratio of 27%.</p><p>In terms of price developments, while stability was a feature of the market in July and August, prices fell markedly in September, although with production expectations lowered, prices are expected to recover slightly before the arrival of new supplies exerts further downward pressure. Declining wheat prices (-30% in the last year) are seen as exerting a downward pressure on rice prices. Over the longer term, from January to September average 2009 indica high quality rice prices were 26.1% below the average level over the same period in 2008, while indica low quality rice prices were 39.2% below the average levels prevailing in the 2008 period and aromatic rice prices were on average 8.2% below the levels prevailing in 2008. Japonica rice prices however were 23% above the comparable average level for January to September 2008.</p>

			<h3>Editorial comment</h3>
			<p>Rice production is expanding in both Africa and the EU, however with rice markets becoming increasingly differentiated, this does not mean that competition is likely to increase between EU and African producers, since they serve different market components. Important questions arise however as to the impact which current IEPA provisions will have on the use of policy tools currently deployed by African governments in support of rice sector developments. This needs to be carefully reviewed prior to the ratification and implementation of the agreed IEPAs, in order to ensure that the policy space for the further promotion of rice sector development is maintained. </p>
